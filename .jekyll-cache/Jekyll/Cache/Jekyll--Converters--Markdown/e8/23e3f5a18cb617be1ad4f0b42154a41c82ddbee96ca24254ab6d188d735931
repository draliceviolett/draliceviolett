I"ø<p>Inspired by <a href="https://manyheadedmonster.wordpress.com/2015/08/07/captured-voices-2/">Helen Rogersâ€™ great recent post for The Voice of the People online symposium</a>, this week Iâ€™m going to write about one of my most complex only children: poet and novelist Cecil Day Lewis (1904-1972).Â  As Helen points out, while Big Data certainly has its place in historical study (and itâ€™s something Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about in order to widen my employability horizons), thereâ€™s also a very important place for intimate, deep reading of texts.Â  In fact, my thesis is basically a bunch of in-depth case studies formed into a vague order, with commentary, and Big Data appeals to me as a way of starting off with a large dataset, but then focussing in on interesting individual details.Â  Day Lewisâ€™ case shows how what might be deemed typical â€˜only-childâ€™ behaviour is a lot more complex than it would seem on the surface, and possibly not even the result of being an only child at all.</p>
