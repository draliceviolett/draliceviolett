I"›<p>â€˜Is blogging academic?â€™ (or â€˜is blogging scholarship?â€™, which I regard as amounting to the same question) is a question thatâ€™s popped up on my Twitter timeline a lot recently, as a panel at the Organization of American Historians grappled with it this week.Â  There are, naturally, a few blog posts out there already on the topic, but I thought that, with some reference to them, Iâ€™d like to add to the debate.Â  Itâ€™s seems like a good time to write such a post, seeing as Iâ€™ve been blogging regularly for four months now, and my last blog post got an amazingly high number of views (this will probably get considerably fewer, but never mind).</p>
