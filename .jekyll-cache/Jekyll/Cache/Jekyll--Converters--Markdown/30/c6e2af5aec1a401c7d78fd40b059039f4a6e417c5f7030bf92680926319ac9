I"i<p>I took this week out of my studies in order to learn about Big Data at my university’s summer school on the subject.  As I enjoy research and am interested by different types of information, and am also trying to expand my skills and get employers to hire me after my PhD, I thought it would be worth going to, and I did indeed learn some new things.</p>
