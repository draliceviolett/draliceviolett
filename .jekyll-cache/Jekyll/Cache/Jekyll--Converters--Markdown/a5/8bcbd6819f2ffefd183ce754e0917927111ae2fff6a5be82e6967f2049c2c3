I"’<p>This week has mainly been about two things: preparing a conference paper Iâ€™m giving, and teaching.Â  Iâ€™ve also managed to squeeze in a little work on my board paper (which looks to be better than the last one, but weâ€™ll see) but there has been no time for reading autobiographies lately - and I do hear that in the academic life, it can be hard to find time for actual research sometimes!</p>
