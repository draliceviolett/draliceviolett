I"s<p>Make no mistake - Iâ€™m a dyed-in-the-wool, card-carrying introvert.Â  Iâ€™m the person who relates to all the fridge-magnet pictures on Facebook and cartoons on Tumblr about finding social interaction exhausting and needing to hide in my cave sometimes, while not necessarily being â€˜shyâ€™.Â  But my chosen career path requires me to teach, network and speak at conferences, so I canâ€™t hide all the time.Â  And you know what?Â  Even though Iâ€™m wiped out by these activities, Iâ€™m not <em>bad</em> at them.</p>

<p>Often, thereâ€™s a gap between what I think I can do and what I actually can do.Â  This week I taught three classes in a row (it was meant to be four, but itâ€™s essay season and nobody turned up to the first one!).Â  I agreed to it because I wanted the experience, it was a subject Iâ€™m personally interested in, and I have a tendency to â€˜take one for the teamâ€™ (see, introverts can do teamwork!).Â  Iâ€™d only taught on my own a couple of times before, a good few months ago, and the prospect of teaching caused me a fair bit of worry because I was imagining my socially-awkward, hide-from-people persona leading the classes in a desultory fashion.Â  There was something Iâ€™d forgotten: that I change roles if I have to work with an audience.</p>

<p>I wouldnâ€™t call it â€˜faking itâ€™ <em>per se</em>.Â  Iâ€™m still being myself when I act outgoing, Iâ€™m giving more voice to things that happen to be in my head naturally.Â  I did the same sort of thing in when I worked in retail - on the bus to work Iâ€™d put my earbuds in and hope to God nobody sat next to me, but as soon as I got behind a till, Iâ€™d be greeting people, offering help and making small talk (if they initiated it!).Â  But I canâ€™t act like that all the time, partly because Iâ€™d probably annoy people, and partly because itâ€™s <em>tiring</em>.Â  That teaching absolutely slayed me and I envy people who can teach and do other worthwhile things afterwards.Â  I also have an annoying habit of analysing everything I did during the lesson, which is great for getting a qualification based on reflection, but not so good if I actually want to calm down and think about something else.Â  This also happened in retail if I came out with something I wasnâ€™t expecting myself to - Iâ€™d keep prodding at it in my head.</p>

<p>Another worry I had was that the students wouldnâ€™t take me seriously because Iâ€™m only eight years (in a couple of cases, only one or two years) older than them.Â  But actually, itâ€™s not age that matters so much as a) having two more qualifications than they have and b) confidence.Â  Iâ€™m not a naturally confident person; Iâ€™ve been described as â€˜diffidentâ€™.Â  So I had to assume an air of confidence I didnâ€™t really feel, certainly not before the seminars anyway.Â  It helped that I did have things to be confident <em>about</em>: Iâ€™d done enough reading and planned enough activities to carry the class/push the students to talk, and generally know how to â€˜doâ€™ history, extracting relevant information and putting it in the right place, not to mention having a sense of the early modern from my previous work.Â  For the same reason, I donâ€™t worry hugely about giving conference papers - I know my work better than anyone else does, and that puts me in a position of security.</p>

<p>Do I want to teach again?Â  Based on my experiences this week, I would say â€˜yesâ€™.Â  Sure, itâ€™s tiring, but when the classes go well, as they did this time, it gives me a bit of a buzz.Â  I thought of myself as an ineffectual teacher before, largely based on having mostly worked with more experienced people I naturally deferred to rather than forcing myself to run the show and stand on my own two feet.Â  But you know what?Â  I <em>can</em> teach.Â  Iâ€™m confident about it.</p>
