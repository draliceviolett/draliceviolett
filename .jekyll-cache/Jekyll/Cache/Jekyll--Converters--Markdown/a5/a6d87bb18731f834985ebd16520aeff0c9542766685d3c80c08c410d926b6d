<p><cite>Darling</cite>, by Rachel Edwards, is this monthâ€™s <a href="https://www.booksthatmatter.org.uk/">Books That Matter</a> title. I was always going to love the concept of a feminist book subscription box; this was my second, and Iâ€™m excited to see what books and gifts they send out in future boxes.</p>

<p><cite>Darling</cite> follows the difficult relationship between Darling, a black nurse, and Lola, her privileged white teenage stepdaughter. Darling meets, moves in with (bringing her disabled young son, Stevie), and marries Lolaâ€™s widowed father, Thomas, in the wake of the 2016 referendum, when racist individuals and groups are becoming increasingly emboldened and visible. Lola hates her on sight.</p>

<p>The genius of <cite>Darling</cite> is that you know from the outset that either Darling or Lola is going to die due to the otherâ€™s actions, but you donâ€™t know who, or how. As a result, I spent the whole book in a state of tension, trying to guess what was going to happen, wondering if the fatal event was just over the page. Itâ€™s therefore little wonder that I read it in just over 24 hours!</p>

<p>Darlingâ€™s experiences of racism from members of a growing nationalist movement further increases the tension, partly because you want to know how it plays out, partly because youâ€™re scared for her, and partly because it - rightly - makes you feel uncomfortable and evokes real-life issues.</p>

<p>For a relatively short, fast read, Rachel Edwards has managed to pack a heck of a lot into <cite>Darling</cite>. Thereâ€™s just so much going on, and loads of themes. The two main characters are at the heart of the novel, though. Lola may come across as a classic horrible teenager, but her journal entries are a vibrant mixture of shocking and entertaining, move the story forward, and reveal more of her character, backstory, and motivations the further you get into the book.</p>

<p>The story is mostly told from Darlingâ€™s point of view. She is an incredibly richly illustrated character, and you learn so much about her - particularly her experiences as a second-generation immigrant from Jamaica, and how her personal values influence her devotion to Stevie and her efforts to endear herself to Lola - but there are also things she doesnâ€™t tell you, or at least, not until the end. I noticed some silences in her narrative, but could never have guessed what the climactic revelations (yes, plural - this book is brimming!) would be. Without giving too much away, the denouement makes you question so many things you thought you knew and felt about these two complex women.</p>

<p><cite>Darling</cite> is rich, timely, unpredictable and unputdownable.</p>
