I"Ô<p>By following a few PhD accounts on Twitter, you canâ€™t help but see some excessive-seeming advice, endless lists of writing and productivity tips (some of which appear to have been cooked up by the same people who write bizarre sex tips for womenâ€™s magazines), and snark from sensible people like myself who donâ€™t feel the need to work on our PhDs <em>all the time</em>.Â  Iâ€™ve had a ridiculously productive week this week.Â  I think that trip to Oxford really fired me up for getting an unprecedented amount of writing done.Â  However, some of my working practices would fill some people who make a living from giving PhD advice with horror.Â  I think the message here is: do whatever the hell works for you.</p>
