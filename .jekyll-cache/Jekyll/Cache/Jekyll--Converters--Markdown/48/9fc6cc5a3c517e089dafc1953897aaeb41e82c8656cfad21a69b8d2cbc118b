I"˜<p>Ah, Foucault.Â  That really talented and prolific French guy who gets referenced by practically everyone in the humanities.Â  Seeing as he had things to say about human nature and the self in terms of â€˜the subjectâ€™, I thought Iâ€™d better read some things by/about him.Â  Iâ€™ve found some things so far that <em>could</em> relate to my thesis, but I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re too forced/tenuous.</p>
