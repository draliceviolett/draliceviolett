I"ß<p>Last weekend I had the honour of being invited to speak at a symposium commemorating the life and work of <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/events/event.aspx?e_id=6991">Leonore Davidoff</a>, who died last October.Â  There were moving speeches from scheduled speakers and audience members alike, and I found it a very touching tribute to a sociologist/historian whose substantial body of work broke a lot of new ground, especially in the fields of gender and family history.</p>
