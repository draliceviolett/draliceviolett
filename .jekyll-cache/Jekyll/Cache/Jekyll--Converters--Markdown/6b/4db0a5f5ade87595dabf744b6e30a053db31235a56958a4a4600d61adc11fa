I"x<p>I read 16 books in March, but only read three of the <a href="/book-blog/2019/03/01/what-i-read-in-february-2019/">books I planned to read</a>. Hoping to get to <cite>The Ladyâ€™s Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</cite> and <cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite> this month instead! I read so much last month because some of the books I picked up were easy and/or exciting reads, so I got through them in a day or two.</p>

<p>I would very much like to read this books this month! I picked up <cite>The Binding</cite> at a fascinating Essex Book Festival event with the author, Bridget Collins, at Colchester Library. I was attracted to <cite>The Thirteenth Tale</cite> by an amazing <a href="https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-diane-setterfield">Meet the Author interview with Diane Setterfield</a>. Iâ€™ve been meaning to read Melissa Harrisonâ€™s <cite>All Among the Barley</cite> for a while, and its being shortlisted for the New Angle Prize finally got me reserving it.</p>

<p>I always pre-order Jane Caseyâ€™s books as soon as theyâ€™re announced so no doubt Iâ€™ll drop everything to read <cite>Cruel Acts</cite> when it lands on my Kindle. And <cite>The Confessions of Frannie Langton</cite> simply looks right up my street, though Iâ€™m not sure if it will come through the reservation system in time for me to read it this month!</p>
