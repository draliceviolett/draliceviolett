I"™<p>Well, I didnâ€™t expect returning to my literature review to make changes, additions and corrections to be quite this hard.Â  I actually think totally re-writing my section/chapter/whatever itâ€™s going to be on perceptions of only children will actually be easier as Iâ€™m starting again with a blank page, as opposed to trying to edit something that now feels as old as that book I posted last week.</p>
