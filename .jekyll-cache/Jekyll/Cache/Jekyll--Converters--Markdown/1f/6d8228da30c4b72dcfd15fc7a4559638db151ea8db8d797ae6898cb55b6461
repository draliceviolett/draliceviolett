I"Ø<p>After the horrors of my third board (not completely negative, but an overwhelming slew of suggestions for improvement made me feel like Iâ€™d never get it right and should just give up), I was apprehensive about the board I had on Wednesday of this week.Â  There wasnâ€™t much I could do to prepare for it (or any board, for that matter) once Iâ€™d emailed in my material for the board to look at, but Iâ€™ve definitely noticed that Iâ€™ve been sleeping better and had a lot more energy since going from the â€˜build-upâ€™ to the â€˜itâ€™s over!Â  Iâ€™m still alive!â€™ stages.Â  It was a good board.Â  I actually came out feeling positive and inspired rather than bogged down and hopeless like the last couple of times.</p>
