I"Õ<p>This week, I attended a lunchtime â€˜Gender and Spaceâ€™ roundtable held by my department.Â  It was well-attended and there were lots of questions and discussion, which was great - we didnâ€™t actually think it would fill the two-hour slot the room was booked for, but it did!Â  There were three main speakers, including a visitor to the department I hadnâ€™t met before, and myself and my fellow PhD student Nicolle Watkins (who chaired) also said a few words.</p>
