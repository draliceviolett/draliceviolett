I"Ç<p>Last week I happened across <a href="https://twitter.com/HARTResearch/status/487488929839714304">this tweet</a>, asking whether we see ourselves as doctoral students or doctoral researchers.Â  I found it a very interesting question to ponder!Thus far, Iâ€™ve automatically referred to myself as a student whenever the occasion to provide my occupation has arisen.Â  In much the same way, I automatically tick â€˜Missâ€™, even though my sensibilities say my marital status is nothing to do with anything - a hangover from youth, possibly (and I get to avoid the whole â€˜Miss/Msâ€™ thing when I become a doctor, yay!).Â  And in some ways, I am a student.Â  The big one is that Iâ€™m producing a piece of work, someoneâ€™s judgment on which will or wonâ€™t result in a qualification.Â  I have a student ID, get student discount and take am automatically a member of the Student Union, whose events I partake in.Â  I socalise with the student body rather than the staff, and were I to become a department committee member, I would be representing students.Â  Any grants I apply for are designated for â€˜studentsâ€™, and I can take advantage of conferences and events aimed specifically at â€˜studentsâ€™.</p>

<p>But in some ways, Iâ€™m more of a researcher.Â  Apart from the supervision and judgement at the end, Iâ€™m pretty much doing what Iâ€™d imagine what Iâ€™d be doing if I was employed as an academic - without the admin, but thatâ€™s not research anyway.Â  When I started, I was told I would be regarded as a junior colleague.Â  I donâ€™t have to go to classes or take tests.Â  Next semester Iâ€™ll be teaching undergraduates - how far do I come under the same category as them?Â  More than anything else, Iâ€™m proving that I <em>can</em> be a researcher - so I have to act like a researcher in order to do that.</p>

<p>The word â€˜studentâ€™ has negative connotations, which are unhelpful when youâ€™re at a certain age and stage in your life.Â  To name a real-life example, when searching for houses, I come across ones that specify that they donâ€™t want students.Â  We always enquire about these anyway, because Iâ€™m not sure that Iâ€™m really the sort of student such restrictive landlords have in mind - thereâ€™s not a group of us, my partner works full-time, Iâ€™m too old and busy to trash the place, and my grant is sufficient that I can afford the rent.Â  Yet, the other week a landlord wouldnâ€™t consider us because he wanted two full-time workers living there - even though I earn as much as someone working full time!Â  Itâ€™s helpful to be a student for the council tax discount though.Â  The housing problem leads to the wider issues of stereotypes - that students are lazy, slovenly, noisy, untrustworthy, drink a lot, arenâ€™t doing â€˜real jobsâ€™â€¦the list goes on.Â  That might have some truth for a small number of undergrads (typically, the ones who donâ€™t do too well!) but trust me, you canâ€™t do a PhD without putting some proper effort in.</p>

<p>So am I a student or a researcher?Â  On balance, I think Iâ€™m more of a student, but I resent the negative things people decide to tar all students with.Â  Itâ€™s really unfair to not be seen as a productive member of society who should be included in things other adults are allowed when you work as much as anyone else.</p>

<p>This photo has nothing to do with anything, I just wanted to include it.</p>
