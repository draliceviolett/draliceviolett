I"<p>This week I’ve been writing.  A lot.  I’ve produced nearly 2,000 words more than I expected to in the amount of time I’ve had, and a topic (the Mass Observation Family Survey) I thought would take up 4,000 words maximum has just hit exactly 8,000 (pre-editing, of course, and with a couple of bits I know I need to add).  It’s been like Lisa Simpson and the tap shoes, but with academic writing.  I’m doing it because my next board paper is due on 9th June, the actual board being on the 19th.</p>
