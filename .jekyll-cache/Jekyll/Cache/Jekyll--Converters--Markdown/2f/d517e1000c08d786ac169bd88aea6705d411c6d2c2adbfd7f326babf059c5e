I"<p>Iâ€™m coming to the end of a four-week trial of Nvivo.Â  Having tested it out, with the help of Bazeley and Jacksonâ€™s guidebook, on my notes from early-twentieth century psychology/sociology articles about only children, Iâ€™m going to keep it for my oral history and autobiography work.Â  This weekâ€™s blog is about my experiences of Nvivo, and using computers in my work in general.</p>

<p>The main thing Iâ€™ve found about Nvivo is that it does everything I need it to do.Â  I already have a huge list of research questions to attach to the information Iâ€™ve taken note of from my sources, and Nvivoâ€™s coding system allows me to do that with a minimum of fuss - I donâ€™t need to use numbers or formulae in order to code a bit of text, and can view everything Iâ€™ve assigned to a certain code very easily indeed.Â  The memo and dataset features will be useful in the extreme, for information about sources I need to keep in mind throughout, such as their family situation, class, schooling and so on.Â  Itâ€™s also really helpful that I can create â€˜setsâ€™, which will be useful for keeping nineteenth- and twentieth-century sources separate when I need to.Â  I also found the modelling feature surprisingly helpful - I wasnâ€™t expecting there to be one, let alone use it, but itâ€™s even better than making a mind map on paper - more colours and I can move the shapes around!Â  I didnâ€™t really have any need of the advanced coding tools (word frequency and the like) or visualisation tools (graphs and what have you) as this was a particularly small and disparate set of sources, but itâ€™s nice knowing theyâ€™re there if it turns out I need them later.</p>

<p>A couple of things did annoy me.Â  I would have liked to been able to ctrl+select different bits of text to be coded at the same time, as I often found Iâ€™d written something like â€˜p. 104 - more self-sufficient and well-adjustedâ€™ and would find myself just coding the word â€˜well-adjustedâ€™ for the â€˜adjustmentâ€™ code rather than the whole sentence, so when I go back to it, itâ€™s going to be a bit disjointed.Â  Another bugbear was that the only help Nvivo themselves seem to offer comes in the form of video chat - no, Iâ€™m too socially awkward for that!Â  I much preferred using the aforementioned book, I can read faster than someone can speak anyway.Â  But thatâ€™s more of a personal preference than anything else.</p>

<p>So, why do I need a program like Nvivo?Â  The simple answer is, I have A LOT of data - when I finish getting it all together, there looks to be 60+ autobiographies and about 66 oral histories to use.Â  Way more than I can reasonably expect to label with sticky notes.</p>

<p>Although, as a Millennial, Iâ€™m very at home with computers, Iâ€™ve never really used them a huge amount for the analysis side of my work, preferring to print my notes/sources out and highlight and label them.Â  Until this year I always wrote my secondary source notes by hand; now I have an awkward hybrid of computer- and hand-written notes, depending whether I read from a book or a screen.Â  Iâ€™ve also found myself using the computer a lot more since Iâ€™ve started using oral history in my work, for the obvious reason that itâ€™s a hell of a lot easier to transcribe that way.Â  And itâ€™s quicker when I go to places like the British Library and need to take copious notes from books, and gets me around the annoying problem of blunt/broken pencils.Â  In fact, Iâ€™ve typed rather than written all my autobiographical notes because thereâ€™s been a lot of verbatim quotation, and I knew I would probably be using Nvivo right from the start.Â  At home, I prefer to read the book first and put page markers in (and, if itâ€™s my book, underline the passages I need to copy/take notes on) and type up the notes later, but at the BL I have to just type up things of interest as I go along.Â  Itâ€™s easier at the BL though because the desks are nice and big - at home I end up sort-of wedging the top of the book between my legs and the desk because thereâ€™s nowhere else to put it!</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s not to say I wonâ€™t miss the joy and pain of extensive highligher and sticky-label use.Â  I expect Iâ€™ll still use them for bits of my thesis where I have a more easily manageable number of sources.Â  Iâ€™m also a big stationery enthusiast, so I donâ€™t think I could ever go entirely digital.</p>
