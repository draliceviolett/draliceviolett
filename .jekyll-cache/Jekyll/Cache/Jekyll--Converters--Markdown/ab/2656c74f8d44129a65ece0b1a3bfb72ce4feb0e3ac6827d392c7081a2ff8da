I"é<p>When Iâ€™m not working on my PhD or messing around on Twitter and Tumblr, Iâ€™m reading for fun.Â  Seems strange that after a day of battling with thick academic texts, I want to strain my eyes more, but what can I say, Iâ€™m a sucker for punishment.Â  Recently, a few things Iâ€™ve read for fun have actually ended up inadvertently relating to my PhD.</p>

<p>The main one was <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Canâ€™t Stop Talking</em> by <em>S__usan Cain</em>.Â  I read this because Iâ€™m an INTJ and wanted to understand myself and my place in the world a bit more.Â  It offered me some hope but I also found something I could use for my literature review!Â  When I got my first draft back, my supervisor commented on my section about Victorian autobiography about how important â€˜characterâ€™ was back then.Â  Well, I couldnâ€™t find a text to reference about that (you try Googling â€˜Victorian characterâ€™, you just get English literature!) and for a while had just put something generic like â€˜character was really important to Victoriansâ€™.Â  But then I found Cain talking about the shift from theÂ <em>Victorian</em> <em>cult of character</em> to the <em>twentieth-cent__ury cult of personality</em> and it was jus what I needed.Â  Not only that, but in relation to that she talks about how it was okay to beÂ <em>quiet</em> in the former period - it basically meant you were thoughtful and economical with your words - but it was far less acceptable in the latter period when <em>outer presentation</em> mattered most - you needed to impress people with what you said.Â  This also relates to the blog post Iâ€™m hoping to do aboutÂ <em>attitudes towards quiet</em> in child guidance manuals over time.Â  The next phase of my work involves reading as many of these manuals as I can to get ideas about attitudes towards things likeÂ <em>only children</em> (of course),<em>socialisation</em> and <em>qualities people wanted to cultivate in children</em>.Â  The subjects ofÂ <em>quiet</em>, <em>introversion</em> and <em>shyness</em> in the manuals should hopefully elucidate the negative things <em>contemporary psychologists</em> had to say about <em>only children</em>.Â Â I reckon in a few weeks I could get a little post from my preliminary work on that.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also been reading <em>Mad Men and Medusas: Reclaiming Hysteria and the Effects of Sibling Relations on the Human Condition</em> by <em>Juliet Mit__chell</em>.Â  I got this out of the library as part of a general sweep for my PhD, but as it was written in 2000, I figured it wouldnâ€™t make it into my research but would nonetheless make an enlightening free-time read.Â  Itâ€™s taking me forever, though, because itâ€™s so complex.Â  Also, Iâ€™m not sure about <em>Freud and his fellow psychoanalysts _in general - some of the stuff they came up with seems so arbitrary and so unproveable that I find it difficult to accept.Â  Nonetheless, in one of the chapters Iâ€™ve read so far, Mitchell talks about how having a brother made a girl feel inferior, and therefore act like that - _an important point</em> for me as Iâ€™m looking at whether <em>only children</em> had less rigid gender behaviour boundaries.Â  She also talks about <em>war and hysteria</em>, including awareness of death and mutilation and the abuse of women to feel alive.Â  That grabbed me because it relates to the reading I did for my <em>MA dissertation</em> aboutÂ <em>gender in the Irish Rebellion of 1641</em>.</p>

<p>On the fiction side (where I usually do reside!), Iâ€™ve recently got into <em>Stephen King</em> in a good way.Â  Since just before Christmas, Iâ€™ve read <em>The S__hining</em>,Â <em>Doctor Sleep</em>, <em>â€˜Salem__â€™s LotÂ _and _Carrie</em>.Â  What Iâ€™ve noticed is that a lot of the main characters in these books are <em>only children</em>.Â  I think thatâ€™s important because it isolates them - Danny and Carrie in particular donâ€™t have any siblings to take the edge off their suffering at the hands of their parents.Â  Something that made for amusing imagery in <em>Doctor Sleep</em> was when someone comments about Abra being an only child - imagine having two or more kids with her powers!Â  Could make for some mischief.Â  More generally, a modern sociology book I read for my PhD mentioned how a lot of <em>childrenâ€™s books characters</em> are <em>only children</em>, and thatâ€™s because a sibling would distract from the action - their adventures would be a bit lame if they had to drag a younger sibling everywhere.Â  Itâ€™s just occurred to me, as a random example, that none of the characters in <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> are mentioned as having siblings - probably a good thing, imagine the fights that would break out over who gets to visit the factory!Â  Though only one of the only children is pleasant, so maybe itâ€™s not great PR for onlies.</p>

<p>PS. Following last weekâ€™s blog, Iâ€™ve found 4-5 potential interviewees for the womenâ€™s oral history project, and might find some more next week (Iâ€™ve basically sent my parents to their hobby groups with missives).Â  Iâ€™m really pleased because I was worried Iâ€™d have nothing to contribute on that front!</p>
