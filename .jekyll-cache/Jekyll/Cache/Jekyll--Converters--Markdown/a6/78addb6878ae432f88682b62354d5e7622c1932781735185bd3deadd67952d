I"ì<p>Given that Iâ€™ve been reading the autobiographies of people worthy of note on ODNB, itâ€™s unsurprising that quite a few of them went to boarding school.Â  Despite growing up on Enid Blyton, I never really fancied the idea, put off by thoughts such as â€˜but if youâ€™re being picked on, you canâ€™t get away!â€™ and â€˜ugh, sharing a room and never being alone ever!â€™Â  With these ideas, Iâ€™m similar to some late-nineteenth/early-twentieth century only children, but not others.</p>
