I"Ù<p>Iâ€™m not one of those who are snobbish about historical novels.Â  <em>Au contraire</em>, I admire anyone who can spin a believable yarn set in the past, and tend to ignore all but the most glaring of inaccuracies and anachronisms.Â  After all, the historical novel is for entertainment, not a scholarly text to be scrutinised.Â  The following are, in my view, the â€˜bestâ€™ (by which I mean most entertaining and transporting) books of the genre that Iâ€™ve read.</p>
