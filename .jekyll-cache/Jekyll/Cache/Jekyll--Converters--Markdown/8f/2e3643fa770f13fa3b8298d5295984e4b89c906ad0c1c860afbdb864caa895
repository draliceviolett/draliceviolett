I"‹<p>This is the first of the more wordy blog posts I hope to make at least once a week.Â  I think Iâ€™ll usually do them on Fridays.Â  I try not to work at the weekend but I thought Iâ€™d do this one today so my new blog doesnâ€™t just consist of two photos!Â  If anyone wants to follow me on here, please be aware that I can only follow back on my primary account, which is silly and frivolous so please donâ€™t feel obliged to follow that one too.</p>

<p>The content of these posts will vary from week to week - sometimes I might talk about my recent activities as a PhD, as I am today, other times I might write about a book Iâ€™ve read, something Iâ€™ve discovered or a project Iâ€™m involved in - or anything else I come up with I feel is worth writing about.</p>

<p>Anyway, today was the last week of term (not that that makes <em>any</em> difference when youâ€™re a PhD, it just means campus goes into hibernation).Â  I had a <strong>supervisory meeting</strong>, a <strong>presentation workshop</strong> and did <strong>some social stuff.</strong></p>

<p>It turns out from theÂ <strong>supervisory meeting</strong> that my <strong>literature review</strong> isnâ€™t too bad, which is pleasing - I just need to make some minor corrections, add a bit more context and make it even better by reading some more books - which Iâ€™m more than happy to do, taking me up to Christmas.Â  Towards the end of next month, I have my <strong>first supervisory board</strong>, which Iâ€™ve been instructed not to be scared of.Â  I know rationally I have nothing to worry about, but that wonâ€™t stop me being a bit nervous!</p>

<p>The <strong>presentation workshop</strong> was good practice for that.Â  I had to do a five-minute presentation about my research, which the other participants were very complimentary about - but again, I was told to be less nervous.Â  Easier said than done.Â  What really struck me was how interested everyone was in my research - I believe itâ€™s because of the â€˜humanâ€™ element of it, and the fact everyone knows what an <strong>only child</strong> is.Â  My MA dissertation on <strong>Gender in the Irish Rebellion of 1641</strong> took a little more exploring and was less relevant to peopleâ€™s lives, so thatâ€™s probably why it didnâ€™t quite generate the same level of interest from non-historians.Â  The person running the session recorded us all and sent each person the video of their presentation.Â  From watching mine back, Iâ€™m a little more convinced that I can actually do presentations.Â  I was awful at presenting at school and was plagued by difficulties speaking loudly and clearly and I still automatically assume Iâ€™m bad at it.Â  In fact, thatâ€™s probably whatâ€™s made me better - Iâ€™ve had to really make an effort to <strong>practice</strong> my presentations to make sure theyâ€™re sufficiently audible.Â  Apart from that, I really didnâ€™t like watching myself very much - my eye was automatically drawn to parts of my appearance I donâ€™t like!</p>

<p>I canâ€™t stress enough the importance of <strong>social stuff</strong> in the life of a PhD student.Â  Youâ€™re always hearing about how isolating it is.Â  Luckily, I get out a lot because of the <strong>Literature Society</strong>, which Iâ€™m vice-president/secretary of, and because <strong>my fellow postgrads</strong> are a lovely, friendly bunch.Â  On Thursday we had the <strong>department Christmas party **and the **staff versus students quiz.</strong>Â  Alas, the staff won, but our team came a respectable second.Â  This week, I was also introduced to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/vicky_holmes">Vicky Holmes</a>, who did her PhD with my supervisor, and we had a lovely hour-long chat in which she gave me a lot of advice and ideas. Iâ€™m particularly looking forward to going to <strong>seminars in London</strong> where I can learn something new and network with other academics in my field.</p>

<p>My plans for the next few weeks are to get my literature review as good as I can for my <strong>supervisory board</strong>, work on turning my <strong>MA dissertation</strong></p>

<p>into an <strong>article</strong>, and start looking at <strong>Paul Thompsonâ€™s oral history transcripts</strong>. Iâ€™ll take time off for Christmas, of course - though I tend to get very bored in the no-manâ€™s-land between Christmas and New Year so I might do some work then. Iâ€™d rather take the time off when I actually have <strong>something else to do</strong>.</p>
