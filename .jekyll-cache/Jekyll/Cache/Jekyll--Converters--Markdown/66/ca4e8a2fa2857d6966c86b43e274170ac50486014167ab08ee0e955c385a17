I"`<p>September is my favourite month because (paradoxically, considering the leaves begin to fall off the trees) it feels like things are starting up and coming back to life. As I explained the other month, <a href="/phd-archive/2019/07/21/i-graduated/">Iâ€™m in the right place for now</a>, but Iâ€™m still getting that sense of new beginnings.</p>

<p>It could be that because I spent so long in education, I just canâ€™t shake off those old September vibes. Maybe itâ€™s because a couple of my friends are starting jobs that are more or less exactly what they want and Iâ€™m getting a vicarious thrill. Perhaps Iâ€™m just excited to go on a (mini) holiday for the first time in yonks. Or I could just be looking forward to all the new books that are coming through!</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t review any books in August, but <a href="/phd-archive/2019/08/04/a-few-thoughts-on-three-identical-strangers/">I did review a film</a>, but a book blog post is coming soon. Iâ€™ve written notes, so it has to happen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/august-collage-2.jpg" alt="The Darkest Hour, Trans Britain, Darkside, The Sea, The Sea" /></p>

<p><cite>The Darkest Hour</cite>, by Barbara Erskine. My newfound love for this author continues apace - 5*</p>

<p><cite>Trans Britain: our journey from the shadows</cite>, by Christine Burns (ed.) - 4*</p>

<p><cite>Darkside</cite>, by Belinda Bauer. I was going to give it a 4 throughout, but the ending was such a cop-out - 4*</p>

<p><cite>The Sea, The Sea</cite>, by Iris Murdoch. I wanted to like it more, as the writing is good and there are some interesting insights into human nature, but reading through metaphorical splayed fingers (you can hardly bear to â€˜watchâ€™ the main character most of the time) wears a bit thin over 500+ pages - 3*</p>

<p><cite>How the Dead Speak</cite>, by Val McDermid - 4.5*</p>

<p><cite>An Orchestra of Minorities</cite>, by Chigozie Obioma. Iâ€™ve never read anything quite like it, and absolutely devoured it for the most part (the last 100 pages dragged a bit) - 4.5*</p>

<p><cite>A Rare Interest in Corpses</cite>, by Ann Granger - 4*</p>

<p><cite>The Turn of the Key</cite>, by Ruth Ware - 4*</p>

<p>I normally pick five books, but I just couldnâ€™t narrow it down this month - and theyâ€™re all new releases! It could have been seven or eight if I was even less disciplined. Jessie Burton and Linwood Barclay are two of those authors whose books I always pre-order on Kindle as soon as I hear theyâ€™ve got new books coming out. Laura Purcell and Ambrose Parryâ€™s previous books were on my <a href="/book-blog/2019/01/02/best-of-2018/">best of 2018 list</a> so I have high hopes of their new releases.</p>

<p><cite>The Truants</cite> is a bit of a wildcard as itâ€™s a debut, but how could I not reserve a novel about an overlooked middle-class girlâ€™s experiences at a Brutalist university in the east?! And as for the new Potkin and Stubbs, well I do like to support my work friends (hi Sophie!), though of course it helps that the first in the series was pretty awesomeâ€¦</p>
