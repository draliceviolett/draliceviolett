I"ß<p>Itâ€™s taken me the best part of a week to write a 30-minute conference paper, and Iâ€™m really annoyed that it took so long.Â  Normally, I can put papers together pretty easily, and in fact find it more pleasurable than thesis-writing because I donâ€™t have to reference, unless Iâ€™m entering a competition.Â  Granted, this paper has had to be 50% longer than those I normally do, but I didnâ€™t foresee it taking more than 50% longer to write, especially as all the information I needed was there in my thesis, and just needed refashioning.Â  I canâ€™t help but think of all the other stuff I could have got done this week if I hadnâ€™t been writing and rewriting this damn paper.</p>

<p>The (hopefully) final paper I now have is pretty much my fourth attempt.Â  Twice, I wrote part of the paper before giving up because the structure just wasnâ€™t working.Â  My thesis and conference papers tend to centre around a lot of case studies, in order to show the sheer variety of only-child experiences I can only convey by presenting several individual stories.Â  Five minutesâ€™ set-up and 15 minutes talking about different cases works fine for a 20-minute paper (well, nobodyâ€™s ever complainedâ€¦) but with an extra ten minutes of case studies, I felt like I would be drowning my audience.Â  My third draft was still pretty case-study heavy, though Iâ€™d divided them into groups, but at least I got to the end of it, which is more than I can say for the first and second drafts.</p>

<p>In the fourth and final draft, Iâ€™ve introduced a bit more variety and stopped trying to do so much.Â  A Twitter friend saw my â€˜so many case studiesâ€™ worry and suggested I talk about my sources and methods, which was a really good idea.Â  As theyâ€™re part of my everyday life, I tend to forget that my sources and methods are things that people might actually be interested in, especially as I havenâ€™t come across many other historians who use NVivo.Â  Whereas before I was covering a hell of a lot of ground, talking about both whether only children got out into their neighbourhoods and where they played, I cut out the whole â€˜where they playedâ€™ part and replaced it with sources and methods.Â  I still talk about 15 people (in four groups), but it feels a lot less boggy.Â  The conference is next Saturday - hopefully my talk is good enough for an audience now!Â  Well, I need to practice and put some timings into the PowerPoint before then, but the writing bit is the hard bit.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s been a lot of talk lately about â€˜slow scholarshipâ€™, and aside from the whole privilege thing (you try going slowly when youâ€™ve got limited funding and already spend more hours on teaching work than you get paid for.Â  Plus, I WANT THIS PHD OVER WITH), I donâ€™t think itâ€™s for me.Â  As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, Iâ€™m very much one for instant gratification and response, which is partly why I blog.Â  Iâ€™m not a very patient person, and I like to feel like Iâ€™ve made progress and got things ticked off the to-do list.Â  I even walk and shop quickly so I can get it out of the way and get to things I actually want to do sooner!Â  I hate feeling like Iâ€™m not moving forward, or only moving forward incrementally, so this has been a very frustrating week for me.</p>
