I"½<p>The â€˜approval of titleâ€™ form is done. Iâ€™m due to hand in my thesis on Friday 8th July.Â  The countdown has begun!</p>

<p>This week, Iâ€™ve done some last-minute reading (Iâ€™ve definitely spent whole days reading books just to add one quote or sentence from them to my thesis), and, following my supervisorâ€™s approval of my conclusion, started going back through my thesis with a fine-tooth comb.Â  Itâ€™s more time-consuming than the broad-brush approach I had with the last round of edits, but itâ€™s definitely yielding results - Iâ€™ve already deleted 170 words from my introduction, and 603 words from my literature review.Â  Itâ€™s going to be alright.</p>

<p>Well, I donâ€™t have time to do any more editing for a few days, because exam marking has landed.Â  Iâ€™ve never had to mark exams before, so itâ€™ll be an experience.Â  It occurred to me this morning that now my course is totally done, so I wonâ€™t be receiving any more communication from my students.Â  I was a totally uncharismatic teacher, but I did like helping them.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s all starting to feel a bit real now, that Iâ€™ve nearly completed my thesis, and within three years too!Â  It really doesnâ€™t seem that long ago that I started, and itâ€™s so weird to think that what was a vague idea nearly four years ago, is now a comprehensive piece of work.Â  Iâ€™m excited, but continue to worry about â€˜afterwardsâ€™.Â  I want to work in either publishing, social research, or the third sector - hopefully someone will have me!</p>

<p>Current state of my PhD desk.Â  Fewer library books than usual as itâ€™s all editing from now on, but a few books I actually own in their place because Iâ€™ve run out of other places to put them.Â  I must admit, I am looking forward to clearing out some of the less interesting autobiographies Iâ€™ve accumulatedâ€¦</p>
