I"õ<p>Following on from the picture I posted last week from a book I wrote at the age of six titled â€˜900 years agoâ€™ (which would now be â€˜920 years agoâ€¦), I thought Iâ€™d post the whole thing.Â  Why?Â  Because I enjoy reading other peopleâ€™s more personal history-related blogs.Â  Because I find it amusing that I seemed to like history at an early age (it was kind of a love-hate relationship actually).Â  Because itâ€™s my blog and I canâ€™t think of anything else to talk about this week.</p>
