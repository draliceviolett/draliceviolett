I"p<p>As I mentioned in the last post, this week I took part in a session 
where a few of us who have been through the process once or more gave 
some undergraduates advice on how to do their IRPs (i.e. 
dissertations).  Although we ended up answering questions as a panel, I 
prepared a guide to the seven stages of a dissertation and I thought I’d
 share my advice here.  Obviously, deadlines, expectations and 
supervisory arrangements vary from place to place, as I found - the 
students I spoke to had to have far more of an idea what they were doing
 by the end of second year and an earlier deadline than I had!</p>
