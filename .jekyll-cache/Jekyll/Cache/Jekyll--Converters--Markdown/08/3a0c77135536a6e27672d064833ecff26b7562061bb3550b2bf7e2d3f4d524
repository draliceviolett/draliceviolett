I"Í<p>To sum up this week, Iâ€™ve read a load more positive/balanced articles about only children, transcribed an interview with one nasty only child and one nice one, discussed my next board with my supervisor which will hopefully be in mid-June (have you ever tried to find a date and time where three academics are free?Â  Itâ€™s <em>painful</em>) and been shopping because in a couple of weeks I have an informal interview for a little job - nothing substantive to write about for a blog, in other words.Â  So, as Iâ€™m feeling reflective, I thought Iâ€™d write about how PhD has measured up to my expectations so far.Â  Hoping it might be of use to anyone whoâ€™s applied for/thinking of applying for a PhD and wants to know more about it.</p>

<p><strong>Misconception One: That PhD would be an isolating experience.</strong>Â  How many people warn you that, as a PhD student, youâ€™ll be extremely lonely?Â  Sure, Iâ€™m on my own when I work, say for a few hours a day.Â  As an introvert, I donâ€™t mind that, and actually get extremely agitated if, for example, someoneâ€™s chatting in the library.Â  I need quiet to concentrate.Â  But Iâ€™ve been lucky thereâ€™s a good number of people in my cohort, not to mention a large MA group I also have friends in.Â  Iâ€™m actually more sociable now than I was at MA, as our year were a pretty disparate bunch.Â  Iâ€™ve got postgrad friends who have the same social interests as me - be it coffee and a catch-up during the day, drinking and dancing at night, or pulling together to get the history postgrads as a whole talking about their research, profiles, career aims and what have you, and even formulating and organising <a href="http://essexpostgraduatehistoryforum.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/university-of-essex-postgraduate-history-forum-conference-call-for-papers/">a little conference</a>.Â  Outside of that, Iâ€™ve met fellow PhDs and post-PhDs who I get along and share research interests with, and theyâ€™ve helped me and I hope that Iâ€™ve helped them.Â  And in neither case do we talk about work <em>all</em> the time - well, we obviously donâ€™t discuss research methods when weâ€™re at the student club night!Â  And just because youâ€™re a postgrad/mature student doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re barred from participating in student societies - being vice-president/secretary of LitSoc has got me out of the house and given me non-work-related tasks to do.</p>

<p>**Misconception Two: Everything is difficult and dramatic.Â  **So far, everything has gone really well, so naturally Iâ€™ve been suspicious.Â  Whereâ€™s that horrible snag everyone is meant to hit?Â  Am I missing something big, and is that why everyone else whoâ€™s doing a PhD seems to be working so much harder than me?Â  Well, according to my supervisor anyway, <em>not everyone hits a huge snag</em>.Â  I do think I may have ended up being supervised by THE MOST RELAXED MAN IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD but if youâ€™re achieving things and not breaking your back over it, donâ€™t over-analyse it, just go with it and enjoy it.Â  Of course you have to work hard and push yourself somewhat, but working hard doesnâ€™t mean bumping into obstacles constantly.Â  I experienced a similar conflict when my friends were seeing the boards as a big ordeal, both the first one and the â€˜conversionâ€™ one - which apparently will just be like a normal board, they just happen to decide whether you continue based on it.Â  My supervisor was constantly reminding me that itâ€™s not a test, and his former students were telling me that they actually <em>enjoyed</em> theirs.Â  Again, maybe Iâ€™m just lucky.Â  You might not be able to be totally calm about these things and I understand why, but on the other hand DONâ€™T PANIC either.</p>

<p><strong>Misconception Three: **</strong>I would become this productive machine.**Â  Surprisingly enough, doing a PhD doesnâ€™t alter your personality or circadian rhythms.Â  Iâ€™m still naturally lazy; for example, Iâ€™ll write 1,000 words or so and feel so pleased with myself that Iâ€™ll take the rest of the day off.Â  I still rarely get up before eight, and even then I have to force myself to do so by taking a slot at the gym that means Iâ€™ll get home and actually do some work before lunchtime.Â  When I was 13, I had a Geocities website (those were the days!), and I remember waking up at seven one morning, thinking I was going to get out of bed and do loads of work on it, then promptly going back to sleep and waking up at 11.Â  The stakes are higher, but I can report that I havenâ€™t really changed - Iâ€™m not so undisciplined that I sleep until 11 unless Iâ€™ve got a gym slot or other appointment, but I can make myself get up before half past nine.Â  I prefer to get up a bit later and work a bit later.Â  And it hasnâ€™t changed that I experience a droop at around 3pm, which sometimes I work through with some kind of stimulant, and other times I take as a cue to have a nap.Â  Basically, thinking â€˜Iâ€™m going to get up early and work all day every day!â€™ isnâ€™t much use when thatâ€™s not how you know you can operate.</p>

<p><strong>Misconception Four: That my days would be filled with research and nothing else.</strong>Â  Kind of related to misconception three, the pre-PhD expectation that I was just being a wimp before and could just work and work and work.Â  But also, you actually end up with a surprising number of engagements when youâ€™re doing a PhD, be they meetings (with staff or catching up with friends, which are both VERY important), short courses or talks.Â  Before I started my PhD, I would ask PhD students what a typical day involves, and now I know why it was such a difficult question to answer.Â  This is what _some _of my days look like:</p>

<p>8:00: Get up, go to the gym, get a shower.<br />
10:00: Do some work.<br />
12:00: Lunch.<br />
12:30: Do more work.Â  Occasional breaks for Twitter.<br />
4:30-5:00: Stop working.Â  Check social media/play a game/sleep.<br />
6:30ish: Cook and eat dinner<br />
7:15ish-midnightish: Leisure time.</p>

<p>This is what one day recently looked like:</p>

<p>8:45: Get up, go to the gym, get a shower.<br />
10:45: Read a journal article.<br />
11:45: Lunch and kill time as no point starting anything when Iâ€™m going out soon.<br />
12:30: Get a bus to the university, drop some money off for a course and sit around a bit.<br />
1:00: Meetings.<br />
3:00: Go to the library but be too busy finding things in the catalogue to do any actual work.<br />
4:00: Go to a talk.<br />
5:30: Wait for and get a bus.<br />
6:00ish: Get home, fall asleep as really tired.<br />
8:00: Cook and eat dinner.<br />
8:45: Leisure.<br />
10:00: Realise I need to order books from the British Library for the next day.Â  Spend ages figuring out what I actually want, whether I can buy them online for cheaper than the train fare or get them from the university library.Â  Find that a couple of books take 48 hours to arrive, so order them for a later date.Â  Get there in the end.<br />
11:00: Leisure.<br />
Midnight: Bed.</p>

<p>Some days, you do just get tied up in admin, or thereâ€™s a meeting and a talk on the same day, and thatâ€™s fine.Â  I think this blog post has basically been an advertisement for not worrying too much and that thereâ€™s no â€˜rightâ€™ or â€˜wrongâ€™ way of doing a PhD - basically, donâ€™t force yourself into a schedule thatâ€™s not right for you, or work into the night if you havenâ€™t had time during the day - as long as youâ€™re reaching all the milestones at the right time, I donâ€™t think it matters.Â  Basically, be ready to write something when the time comes to write a paper for a board, and have something to report when you meet your supervisor, and youâ€™re doing it right.</p>
