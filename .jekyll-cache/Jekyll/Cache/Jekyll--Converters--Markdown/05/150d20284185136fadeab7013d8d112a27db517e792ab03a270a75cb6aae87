I"ê<p>To sum up this week, Iâ€™ve read a load more positive/balanced articles about only children, transcribed an interview with one nasty only child and one nice one, discussed my next board with my supervisor which will hopefully be in mid-June (have you ever tried to find a date and time where three academics are free?Â  Itâ€™s <em>painful</em>) and been shopping because in a couple of weeks I have an informal interview for a little job - nothing substantive to write about for a blog, in other words.Â  So, as Iâ€™m feeling reflective, I thought Iâ€™d write about how PhD has measured up to my expectations so far.Â  Hoping it might be of use to anyone whoâ€™s applied for/thinking of applying for a PhD and wants to know more about it.</p>
