I"¤<p>This week, on Monday 12th May, I took part in the annual <a href="http://www.massobs.org.uk/12may.html">Mass Observation Day</a>, when people are called upon to record everything they did during the day.Â  I did it last year, but, being a Sunday, I didnâ€™t really have much to report - I only left the house to go to Tesco!Â  This yearâ€™s was a lot more involved, so Iâ€™m going to write about my experience of being a Mass Observer for the day.</p>

<p>Having more to say meant that it wasnâ€™t necessarily easy, but I did enjoy it.Â  I found myself noticing things like what music was playing in a shop, or changes in the weather, and thought â€˜I need to remember this for when I write the next bitâ€™.Â  I decided to write the diary on segments whenever I had a gap, on whatever device was closest to hand, phone, tablet or laptop with a Google document - laptop was definitely easiest, but least convenient to take out and about with me.Â  I found myself summing up a phone conversation I could overhear behind me in a coffee shop, using the tablet.Â  Itâ€™s not quite on the level of the original Mass Observers, who would scribble down whole conversations verbatim and give a description of the talkers - I didnâ€™t want to be caught staring at a stranger! - but they probably didnâ€™t make the mistake of sitting in window seats or typing instead of scribbling things, which in that situation would be much quicker (and they couldnâ€™t exactly drag their typewriters around with them).</p>

<p>So, what use will this be to future historians?Â  I think some, but Iâ€™m also aware that I wrote a load of trivial stuff that will probably be of no use to anyone.Â  I feel sorry for future historians as it is because thereâ€™ll be so many throwaway tweets of dubious value for them to sift through, so hopefully the diaries will be of benefit in that theyâ€™ve been written with a focus and view to future use.Â  On the other hand, it might have been useful if Iâ€™d remembered to mention what town I live in, and I donâ€™t think anyone <em>really</em> needs to know the name and colour of my cat, or that I saw him on my way to the gym, or that I stopped at The Body Shop to sniff a new body butter.Â  But I think I did represent a few possible topics/issues that might be of interest in the future:</p>

<p>1) Exercise.Â  In case anyone gets the idea, from the newspapers, that everyone in 2014 was totally lazy.<br />
2) Internet use.Â  I was rather aware that I wrote that I checked Twitter a few times during the day, but in my defence, it was at times I was taking a break, and only for short amounts of time.Â  But the way we - or at least, I - use the internet has changed with the advent of always-on internet, smartphones and tablets.Â  It used to be that the internet was something I could go on for half an hour after 6pm, then it was something I used all evening after school, on a desktop, then something Iâ€™d use for lengthy periods at all times of day, on a laptop, and now, for fun/social stuff anyway, I tend towards little and often on handheld devices, between other tasks.Â  I think that internet use would be something major to come out of these diaries.<br />
3) Being a woman.Â  In particular, a bloke at the bus stop started talking to me about tights and stockings, and I noted that I felt a bit weirded-out.<br />
4) The things people talk about in public.Â  I noted down a couple of things I overheard - the conversation in the coffee shop, which was a business conversation, and a joke about STDs a woman made on the bus.Â  I also generally noted that Iâ€™d gone past a graveyard where it was kicking off a bit between some people who were hanging out there.Â  Could make for part of an interesting study into the (in my opinion, largely good) relaxation of what people talk about/do in public?<br />
5) Being a PhD student.Â  In particular, the guilt that still pops up sometimes even though IÂ <em>know</em> itâ€™s okay not to be hugely productive every day.Â  I noted that I felt like I hadnâ€™t done as much work as Iâ€™d liked because Iâ€™d been so busy with other things, but I did note down what work I did - reading off the computer and taking notes in Word.Â  Going back to that thing about how thereâ€™s no typical day in the life of a PhD student, really - some days youâ€™re really productive, other days other tasks get in the way a bit.</p>

<p>Future historians, you can have those ideas for what to do with the May 12th Diaries for free.Â  I also hope you can get something from the oral history interviews Iâ€™ll be conducting.Â  Despite the name, history isnâ€™t all backward-looking!</p>
