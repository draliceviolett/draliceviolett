I"Ö<p>At the beginning of this month, I was sick of my PhD.Â  Iâ€™d had no time to work on it over Christmas because of all the marking I had to do, and I had a particularly uninspiring to-do list, the most tedious tasks on which were Nvivo coding (OK in small doses, but not something you want to do all day), and my oral history control group (peopleâ€™s life histories can be quite interesting, but sitting there WAITING for them to say something relevant when you could be doing something more fun is boring as).Â  My supervisor picked up on my complete and utter boredom and suggested I take a break and do something thesis-related but actually fun - which I interpreted as READING!Â  I saved myself from the tedium not only by dedicating a week of afternoons to reading secondary works, but by building reading back into my everyday work in order to get through the ever-expanding list of books I need to read, but also to get a bit of fun and inspiration back into my days.</p>
