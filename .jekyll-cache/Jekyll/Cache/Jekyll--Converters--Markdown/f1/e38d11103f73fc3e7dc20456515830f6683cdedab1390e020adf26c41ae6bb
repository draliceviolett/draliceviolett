I"æ<p>DISCLAIMER: This piece of research is based on the experiences of a very small number of Paul Thompsonâ€™s interview transcripts, which can be found through the <a href="//www.ukdataservice.ac.uk%E2%80%9D">UK Data Service</a>. I donâ€™t have any plans to include Christmas as a separate subject in my thesis, though it may form a part of a larger section on loneliness. Even then, Iâ€™ll have used a lot more sources and I donâ€™t expect it to bear any resemblance to this post.</p>
