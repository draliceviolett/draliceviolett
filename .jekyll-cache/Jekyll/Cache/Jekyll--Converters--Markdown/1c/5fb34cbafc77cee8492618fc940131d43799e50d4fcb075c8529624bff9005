I"g<p>Last week I met up for coffee (well, hot chocolate - if I liked coffee my life would be A LOT easier and my stomach probably less rotted from sugar-free Red Bull) with one of my PhD colleagues.Â  The conversation turned to how we hate the question â€˜howâ€™s the PhD going?â€™ and how the answer is always along the lines if â€˜urgh, alright, I supposeâ€™.Â  We all know PhDs are really hard, and they wouldnâ€™t be worth very much if anyone could do one.Â  But there is this culture that, even if itâ€™s going amazingly, you have to tone it down.Â  You canâ€™t look like youâ€™re having too much fun (unless youâ€™re trying to sell the PhD at an open evening).Â  Itâ€™s like youâ€™re somehowÂ â€˜letting the team downâ€™ if things are going reasonably well.Â  There are really hard times and, being of a realistic (some say pessimistic) nature, I often find it hard to be positive about the PhD myself.Â  So, this post, Iâ€™m deliberately going to write about the parts of my PhD that are going quite well at the moment, actually.Â  Iâ€™m not saying everyone is having an objectively nice time, of course - just finding things in my experience that I sometimes lose sight of!</p>

<p>**The writing is going well.Â  **Iâ€™ve written something like 14,000 words in the past month without busting a gut - just the odd writing day where I manage about 2,000 words here and there.Â  Iâ€™ve written one chapter, and my supervisor has hinted that itâ€™s good - apparently, the close-up on peopleâ€™s lives was totally the way to go.Â  Thatâ€™s given me the confidence to make a start on the next chapter while Iâ€™m waiting to find out what editing I need to do.</p>

<p>**I know my subjects pretty damn well.Â  **Iâ€™ve read hundreds of the childhood-bits of autobiographies and listened to a pile of oral histories, yet I feel like I <em>know</em> a lot of the only children.Â  For instance, Iâ€™ll be able to remember who said a certain thing, and even the title of the autobiography it came from.Â  Iâ€™ll start reading my notes from an oral history transcription and be like â€˜I remember this person, they did XYZâ€™.Â  And according to some reading I did this week, the fact that I recognise that I myself am not completely coherent personality-wise helps me empathise with my only children.Â  Yay!</p>

<p>**Iâ€™ve got a ton of reading done.Â  **Remember that post I did about learning to love my PhD again by reconnecting with the secondary literature?Â  By continuing to read, Iâ€™ve been building up my bibiliography, and I feel like Iâ€™m getting more knowledgeable, too.Â  Also, I just really love reading, so itâ€™s fun to sit down and spend the afternoon expanding my mind and not feel guilty because itâ€™s my job.</p>

<p>**I have something to offer.Â  **Iâ€™ve been asked to give some advice to second years who are about to start their Independent Research Projects (dissertations to you and me).Â  I actually feel like Iâ€™m qualified to give them that advice.Â  Whatâ€™s more, Iâ€™m not afraid to stand in front of them and give it.Â  Hooray for pushing myself to do - and succeeding at - giving conference presentations and teaching.</p>

<p>Of course, the real challenge is continuing to remember the positive things - especially after next monthâ€™s board, if itâ€™s anything like the last one.Â  Itâ€™s so easy to get bogged down with the difficulties and things that arenâ€™t going so well with a PhD, and Iâ€™m certainly susceptible to it.Â  Maybe Iâ€™ll be able to look at this post in the future and itâ€™ll cheer me up a bit.</p>
