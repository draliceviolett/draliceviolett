I"<p>I’ve only just got into Charles Dickens.  Of course, I knew the stories everyone knows from films (admittedly the Muppet and musical versions respectively).  I’m probably quite late in doing so at 26, but then again, having taken them up of my own accord rather than been forced to study them at school, I feel like I can enjoy them.  I was initially attracted by repeated assertions that family relationships and the treatment of children crop up a lot in Dickens’ novels, and stuck with the books because they were timeless, very readable, with strong characterisation and subtle (and unsubtle) humour.  So far, I’ve read <em>Bleak House</em>, <em>A Tale of Two Cities</em>, and <em>David Copperfield</em>.  Something that struck me about all three novels was the proliferation of only children in them - they seemed to be far more prevalent than they really were in the period.  Although Dickens’ time barely overlapped with the formation of only-child stereotypes, I reckon he had a better grip on only children than the emerging child guidance writers.  While some of his only-child characters display what might be termed ‘typical’ only-child traits and experiences, others are kind, well-adjusted and successful, reflecting my own findings about variety within only children.</p>
