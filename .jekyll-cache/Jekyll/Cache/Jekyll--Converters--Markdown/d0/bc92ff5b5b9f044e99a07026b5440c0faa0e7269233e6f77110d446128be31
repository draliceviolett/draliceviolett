I"ð<p>After the horrors of my third board (not completely negative, but an overwhelming slew of suggestions for improvement made me feel like Iâ€™d never get it right and should just give up), I was apprehensive about the board I had on Wednesday of this week.Â  There wasnâ€™t much I could do to prepare for it (or any board, for that matter) once Iâ€™d emailed in my material for the board to look at, but Iâ€™ve definitely noticed that Iâ€™ve been sleeping better and had a lot more energy since going from the â€˜build-upâ€™ to the â€˜itâ€™s over!Â  Iâ€™m still alive!â€™ stages.Â  It was a good board.Â  I actually came out feeling positive and inspired rather than bogged down and hopeless like the last couple of times.</p>

<p>I think the main reason I had a better time at this board is that Iâ€™m a lot more interested in the material I wrote for it.Â  I mean, I am interested in what the stereotypes of only children were, and how they came about, as per part 1 of my thesis and submissions for my last two boards, but it doesnâ€™t compare with the actual human experience side.Â  Besides, loads of people have traced the stereotype back to some extent, I just did it more deeply and cast around for more explanations for it.Â  My oral history interviews and autobiographies havenâ€™t been used in this combination or for this reason before, and I think thatâ€™s what makes part 2, the actual experiences and feelings of only children, more special.Â  Itâ€™s also whatâ€™s going to make it really long, however - one criticism was that my current thesis outline, which I also submitted, had too many chapters in it.Â  Iâ€™d like to condense part 1 more to fit more in, and maybe save the surplus chapters for articles or (in a perfect world) the book.</p>

<p>What everyone really liked about my paper was its sensitivity and nuance, which I had worried about to some extent because I had to mention so many things about peopleâ€™s lives that the paper just kept getting longer and longer.Â  There are things I could draw out more, but overall the Board seemed rather pleased that I kept returning to the topics of class and community type.Â  Apparently Iâ€™ve successfully refuted the only-child stereotype in the chapter with my in-depth look at other things that could have affected only childrenâ€™s (and sibling childrenâ€™s) personalities, and as that was my aim, thatâ€™s good to know.</p>

<p>One part of the chapter I was advised to condense was the shedload of information about personality psychology I prefaced it with.Â  Iâ€™m still glad I wrote it all out in the first place, though, as Iâ€™m usually criticised for the opposite - not explaining or justifying my framework enough.Â  And, to be honest, Iâ€™m looking to go way over the word limit, so if anyone tells me something can be cut, Iâ€™m going to be on it like a shot.</p>

<p>So, now I donâ€™t have to think about a board for a few months.Â  But I donâ€™t currently fear them, as my forthcoming chapters take much the same approach as the one I submitted this time - looking at lives in some detail to knock down the stereotype.Â  And nobody said I needed a lot more context this time.Â  Hooray!</p>
