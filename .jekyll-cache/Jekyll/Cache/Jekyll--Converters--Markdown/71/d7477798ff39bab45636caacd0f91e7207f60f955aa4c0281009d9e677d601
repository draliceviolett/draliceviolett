I"™<p>Not much to report this week, to be honest - currently in marking hell, where I will also be at the start of next week and on the weird days of purgatory between Christmas and New Yearâ€™s.Â  I did go to the Terror and Wonder Gothic exhibition at the British Library today though - as well as being extremely interesting, it was nice to see a bit of the library other than the reading rooms.</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t be posting the next two Fridays what with it being that time of year and all, though Iâ€™m going to try to tidy up the sidebar a bit by consolidating the links to previous posts into months, which means there will still be some activity.Â  In the meantime, hereâ€™s a terrible thing I wrote last year that got rather overlooked because not many people knew about my blog then.Â  Thanks to everyone whoâ€™s read my blog this year, and I hope I can stay interesting enough to keep you coming back in 2015.Â  So without further adoâ€¦</p>

<p>On the twelth day of Christmas my research gave to me<br />
12 corrective scribbles<br />
11 library books<br />
10 journal articles<br />
9 development courses<br />
8 conferences<br />
7 different archives<br />
6 boards a-sitting<br />
5 RE-ED BUUUUUUUUUULLS<br />
4 published works<br />
3 dead ends<br />
2 big rewrites<br />
And a history PhD!</p>
