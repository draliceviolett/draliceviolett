I"ç<p>I nearly have a draft for Chapter One (public perceptions of only children) again!Â  I just need to read it over and slap on a conclusion, which I should hopefully manage today.Â  This chapter was a real struggle to get off the ground, partly because the original was pretty rubbish and I started again from scratch on it, and partly because there was a lot of information to put in order.Â  But I finally hit my stride and it contains everything I wanted to put in it!Â  Hooray!</p>
