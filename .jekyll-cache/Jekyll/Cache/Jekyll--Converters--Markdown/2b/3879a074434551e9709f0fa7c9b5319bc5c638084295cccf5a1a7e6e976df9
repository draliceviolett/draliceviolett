I"\<p>Seeing as it’s my birthday, I thought I’d do a blog post with the theme of only children’s birthday parties.  What I’m hoping to show is that only children <em>did</em> have friends, and that there was a big variation in how they celebrated their birthdays, and the reasons for this variation were not that they were only children.</p>
