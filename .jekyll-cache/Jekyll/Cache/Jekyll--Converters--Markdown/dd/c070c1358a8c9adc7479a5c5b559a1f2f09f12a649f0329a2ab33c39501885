I"<p>So, more things were going to happen this week, but then they didnâ€™t because of <strong>strikes</strong>.Â  In both cases I support the strikes (London Underground and university staff) but I have less to write about than I planned.Â  I did, however, go to an enlightening <strong>talk on imposter syndome</strong> and do/read <strong>a couple of interesting things</strong>, so Iâ€™ll blog about those.</p>
