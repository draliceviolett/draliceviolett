I"¼<p>Last Friday I went to (and spoke at!) the abovementioned conference.Â  It was a day choc-full of thought-provoking talks, incorporating two keynotes and four panels: Childrenâ€™s Voices, Institutions: Health, Childhood in Time and Space, and Institutions: Religion, Soldiers, Diplomats.Â  My paper was part of the â€˜Institutions: Healthâ€™ panel, and was about studying the psychology articles published between 1927 and 1949 that challenged existing ideas about only children.Â  Much as Iâ€™d like to write about every single paper I listened to, that would make for a very long blog, so Iâ€™m going to write about the three I got the most from and say that everyoneâ€™s talk was very good!</p>
