I"“<p>Happy New Year, folks! I canâ€™t complain about 2013 really; I got to spend the summer researching and writing my MA dissertation, got a distinction for it, started my PhD (making some lovely new friends in the process), and had a fab holiday in Amsterdam when I wasnâ€™t working.</p>

<p>However, I donâ€™t intend to rest on my laurels in 2014. I hope to get a journal article accepted, present a paper at least one conference and pass my confirmation board. On the fun side, Iâ€™m planning to go to Berlin on holiday this year. And of course, I intend to keep doing a lengthy post on this blog every Friday.</p>

<p>Suppose Iâ€™d better get started!</p>
