I"À<p>Autobiography-reading is chugging along nicely, and I should hopefully reach at least the statistically-okay number of thirty from people born in the nineteenth century (as opposed to people who actually write in the nineteenth century, as weâ€™re talking people born after about 1850 here!).Â  Physical illness seems to be a recurring theme, with 14/20 autobiographers so far talking about it in some form.Â  This is interesting, partly from the contemporary/near-contemporary view that only children were less healthy, but also from the vague idea Iâ€™ve picked up regarding Victorian/Edwardian fetishisation of illness - Iâ€™ve done no reading whatsoever on the subject, but do wonder if illness is such a noticeable feature of autobiographies of those who had siblings, and whether those without siblings really were more fragile, had more anxious parents, or were onlies _because _their illnesses had put their parents off having further children.</p>
