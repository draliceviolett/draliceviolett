I"&<p>Firstly, the hopeful news (I hesistate to say ‘good’ when I’ve still got so far to go): with the exception of the conclusion, which I plan to write right at the very end, all the chapters of my thesis (and a couple more besides) are drafted!  I’ve written everything I want to say - now I need to slim it down, totally rewrite some chapters and edit/rearrange som others.  I just did my first ever word count of the whole lot, and I have 110,446 words - so that’s a whopping 30,446 to lose.  So, what’s my plan from here on in?</p>
