<p><strong>The board is set…</strong></p>

<p>My first supervisory board has been confirmed for four weeks today.  My literature review is pretty much ready (though I might decide to add some things to it in the meantime) but I’m not exactly going to be relaxed about it - I don’t do calm when it comes to talking to people!  Alas, these things have to be done and nobody enjoys them.  I reckon I’ve done enough research to know what I’m talking about, and there’s plenty of time to prepare at least.</p>
