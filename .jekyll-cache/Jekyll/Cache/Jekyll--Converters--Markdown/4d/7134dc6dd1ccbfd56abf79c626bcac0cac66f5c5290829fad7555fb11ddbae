I"h<p>When I’m not working on my PhD or messing around on Twitter and Tumblr, I’m reading for fun.  Seems strange that after a day of battling with thick academic texts, I want to strain my eyes more, but what can I say, I’m a sucker for punishment.  Recently, a few things I’ve read for fun have actually ended up inadvertently relating to my PhD.</p>
