I"]<p>I’m _hoping _to spend today doing a lot of writing, so I thought I’d make thing a bit easier for myself by doing a more picture-based than text-based blog.  This is ‘My History Book’, not an actual history this time, more of an annual format/advertisement for myself really.  I’m guessing I was six when I wrote this one as well.</p>
