I"Ö<p>Iâ€™m _hoping _to spend today doing a lot of writing, so I thought Iâ€™d make thing a bit easier for myself by doing a more picture-based than text-based blog.Â  This is â€˜My History Bookâ€™, not an actual history this time, more of an annual format/advertisement for myself really.Â  Iâ€™m guessing I was six when I wrote this one as well.</p>

<p>The cover promises youâ€™ll learn about me.Â  You donâ€™t, really.Â  But itâ€™s copyrighted, so nobody can steal it.</p>

<p>This book was separate from the â€˜storie booksâ€™ I usually wrote.Â  I only have maybe four decent story books, and Iâ€™m umming and aahing about whether to post them because they include people who might mind.</p>

<p>Oh, just get on with it.Â  I would still like to sell books Iâ€™ve written now that I am bigger.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m the one without glasses.Â  Anyone with a ponytail looked like Agnes from <em>Despicable Me</em> in my drawings, anyone with really short hair just got a block.Â  Where are all the limbs?!</p>

<p>A fun activity and me apparently being stabbed by a ginormous pencil.</p>

<p>When I was little, I thought my school was really far away because it took a few twists and turns to get there.Â  It probably actually took 10-15 minutes to walk.Â  In the same vein, I once tried to take pretty much my entire tape collection on a trip to a supermarket about 10 miles away.</p>

<p>More blockheads.Â  I think maybe the message behind this was â€˜men are silly, arenâ€™t they?â€™</p>

<p>I have â€˜Get Busy With Aliceâ€™ but thereâ€™s not a huge amount in it.Â  It also features a disproportionately-sized pencil.Â  Wondering if I adopted the phrase â€˜Right On Timeâ€™ from the song.Â  Apparently you are commanded to like me by books 0 (I guess I started at 1, then realised I needed one before it), 1, and 2.</p>

<p>Can you also please screw in the bottom of the handle on the right door?Â  Itâ€™s come a bit loose.Â  I would join up the school and fix the door handle, but as you can see, I donâ€™t have any arms.</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s where that book ends!Â  And now to continue to wage war on this chapter.</p>
