I"N<p>I have a lot of time for sociologist and feminist Ann Oakley.  Not only have her 1984 autobiography, <em>Taking It Like A Woman</em>, and an oral history interview with her been extremely useful for my only child research, but I regard her as an example and somewhat of a role model.  I love how she extended sociology to include women with her pioneering research into housework, challenged what women were expected to be in the 1960s and ’70s, and she’s written a lot of sense about the issues faced by women and onlies.  I wasn’t disappointed by her latest book, <em>Father and Daughter</em>, which is part autobiography, part biography of her father, iconic social researcher Richard Titmuss, part history of social work in general, all the time keeping in view Titmuss’ place in relation to her and the field he worked in.</p>
