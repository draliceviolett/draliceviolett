I"<p>I spent Thursday and Friday of this past week in Leeds (hence the late blog post - it was a long journey back!) at the ‘Birth: Personal stories to population policies’ conference.  The full programme can be found <a href="http://www.birth.leeds.ac.uk/programme">here</a>, and I also livetweeted most of the papers (alas, train trouble meant I missed the first session on the Friday) on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/histbirth?f=realtime&amp;src=hash">#histbirth hashtag</a>.  I’m not going to talk about every single paper as it would make for an insanely long blog post and you could just read my tweets, but I am going to blog here about my particular favourites.  It was hard to choose as they were naturally all excellent and accomplished!</p>
