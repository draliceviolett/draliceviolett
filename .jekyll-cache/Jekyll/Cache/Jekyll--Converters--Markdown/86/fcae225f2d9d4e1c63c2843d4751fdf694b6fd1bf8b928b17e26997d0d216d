I"µ<p>â€¦well, maybe not so much â€˜favouriteâ€™ as just â€˜all the ones I listen to because Iâ€™ve only just got into podcasts and am working my way through a few different ones.â€™Â  And my favourite podcast of all is <a href="http://www.theblacktapespodcast.com">The Black Tapes</a>, which I couldnâ€™t relate to history if I tried.Â  But yeah, podcasts.Â  Didnâ€™t really used to bother with them, because Iâ€™d have rather been listening to music or reading, now something to listen to between going to bed and going to sleep, or in the bath (less risk of soggy technology death with a phone on the floor than a Kindle in the bath).Â  Now I have ones I particularly like and everything.</p>
