I"Ó<p>Today and tomorrow mark the culmination of nine months of hard work by me and my PhD buddy Nicolle.Â  No,weâ€™re not having a baby - weâ€™re having a conference, which Iâ€™m pretty sure is just as joyful and stressful.Â  Itâ€™s called â€˜Myth and Popular Memoryâ€™ (#mythpop if youâ€™re on Twitter), and hopefully it will be wonderful (if I post about some other subject next week, youâ€™ll know Iâ€™m too traumatised to talk about it).Â  There have been some things Iâ€™ve liked about organising a conference, and some things Iâ€™ve not enjoyed so much.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s start with the positives.Â  My favourite thing about organising a conference has been the creativity.Â  From coming up with the original idea, to making the Call For Papers, to putting together conference packs (I canâ€™t take credit for creating the programme, although I had a damn good time colour-coding abstracts that seemed to have things in common), itâ€™s been an opportunity to come up with ideas and throw words and pictures together in pleasing ways.</p>

<p>Something else I really enjoyed was reading peopleâ€™s abstracts.Â  I can see myself getting massive â€˜thesis envyâ€™ over the two days, as I love hearing about what other people do in their research, and often think â€˜I wish I was doing thatâ€™.Â  Weâ€™re inviting our speakers to contribute guests posts to the conference blog after the conference, in the hope that weâ€™ll keep the conversation going, and Iâ€™m really looking forward to reading them.Â  That leads me to another thing I liked doingâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦the social media side of the conference.Â  Iâ€™ve particularly liked running the Twitter account, not only for promoting the conference and annoucing deadlines for abstracts and registration, but for sharing things Iâ€™ve come across online that relate to the conference theme.Â  Iâ€™ve enjoyed creating a buzz and seeing the evidence for this in the form of followers and retweets, as well as views of the call for papers on our Wordpress site.Â  I really hope that people do use the hashtag for live-tweeting, conversations and pictures.Â  Also online, I liked making the registration form (and seeing new people appear on the associated spreadsheet) and researching restaurants for the conference meal.</p>

<p>What hasnâ€™t been so fun?Â  THE FEAR.Â  First youâ€™re worried that nobody will care about your call for papers; they wonâ€™t share it or send in abstracts.Â  Then youâ€™re worried that nobody will actually want to/be able to come to speak or listen.Â  Then youâ€™re paranoid that every single speaker will drop out, youâ€™ll never get the catering sorted, the restaurant wonâ€™t have enough space for your booking, and youâ€™ll never get peopleâ€™s car parking sorted (actually, Iâ€™m still waiting on that one at the time of writingâ€¦).Â  I think I might just about manage to relax and stop worrying on Saturday afternoon, once nothing has the potential to go wrong.Â  By that time Iâ€™ll have given my paper (scary), chaired a panel (scary), and managed to get everyone to the restaurant and back again (scary).</p>

<p>So please, whether youâ€™re at the conference or not, follow the #mythpop hashtag and pray to your preferred deity that things will go okay for us!</p>
