I"Œ<p>Iâ€™ve finally returned from marking hell with some (hopefully) interesting things to blog about.Â  As my other major task over the holidays was to write a paper for a conference Iâ€™m speaking at next week (and I see other conferences on the horizon), and blog posts and conference papers are two of my favourite things to write, I thought it would be fun to write a post comparing them.</p>
