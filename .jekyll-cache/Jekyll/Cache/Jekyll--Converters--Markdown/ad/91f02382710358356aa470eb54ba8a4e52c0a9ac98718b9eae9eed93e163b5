I" <p>Last week I met up for coffee (well, hot chocolate - if I liked coffee my life would be A LOT easier and my stomach probably less rotted from sugar-free Red Bull) with one of my PhD colleagues.Â  The conversation turned to how we hate the question â€˜howâ€™s the PhD going?â€™ and how the answer is always along the lines if â€˜urgh, alright, I supposeâ€™.Â  We all know PhDs are really hard, and they wouldnâ€™t be worth very much if anyone could do one.Â  But there is this culture that, even if itâ€™s going amazingly, you have to tone it down.Â  You canâ€™t look like youâ€™re having too much fun (unless youâ€™re trying to sell the PhD at an open evening).Â  Itâ€™s like youâ€™re somehowÂ â€˜letting the team downâ€™ if things are going reasonably well.Â  There are really hard times and, being of a realistic (some say pessimistic) nature, I often find it hard to be positive about the PhD myself.Â  So, this post, Iâ€™m deliberately going to write about the parts of my PhD that are going quite well at the moment, actually.Â  Iâ€™m not saying everyone is having an objectively nice time, of course - just finding things in my experience that I sometimes lose sight of!</p>
