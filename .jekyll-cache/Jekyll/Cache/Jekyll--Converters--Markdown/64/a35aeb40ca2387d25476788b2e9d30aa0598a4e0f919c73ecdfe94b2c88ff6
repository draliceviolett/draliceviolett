I"¦<p>You know the classic cocaine addiction story, where the person takes it again and again and again to try to match the original, amazing high?Â  My PhD boards seem to follow the same pattern.Â  My first board went really well, and I thought, â€˜hey, boards arenâ€™t so bad, people sit around and say nice stuff to me!â€™.Â  Unfortunately, my second and third boards didnâ€™t live up to that standard, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever have a board that good again.Â  This weekâ€™s board was so disappointing that Iâ€™m going to dread them in the future.Â  My emotional trajectory during and since the board on Tuesday hasnâ€™t been unlike the five stages of grief, in fact.</p>
