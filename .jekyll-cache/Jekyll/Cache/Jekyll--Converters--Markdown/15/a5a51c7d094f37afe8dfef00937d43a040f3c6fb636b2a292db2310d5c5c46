I"@<p>So, I’ve been reading nineteenth century child guidance manuals for a little while now, and next Tuesday I need to give my supervisor some sort of idea of where I’m getting with them.  This blog post is an attempt to knit them all together, benefitting myself, but hopefully other people will find it an interesting read!  This is very much preliminary, so hopefully I won’t accidentally plagiarise myself when it comes to writing this up for real.  Anyway, the real thing will have better-considered language and some stuff about the popularity of the books.</p>
