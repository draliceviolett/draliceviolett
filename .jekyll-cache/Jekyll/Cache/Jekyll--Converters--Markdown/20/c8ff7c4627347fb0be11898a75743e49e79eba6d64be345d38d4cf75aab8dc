I"Þ<p>A bit of a break from my normal blog routine this week as I went to the abovementioned conference on Saturday but also want to post a book review on Friday.Â  I didnâ€™t speak at the conference as I couldnâ€™t think of a non-tortured way to get my research to fit the theme, but I found a lot to interest me, but it was lovely to be able to enjoy the conference and not have to worry about giving a paper.Â  As usual, all the papers were interesting, but Iâ€™ll talk about the ones that really stood out to me personally to avoid a massive post (also, there were parallel sessions so I naturally only saw half the papers anyway!).Â  It was a very interdisciplinary conference, so I felt like my brain was given a good workout!</p>
