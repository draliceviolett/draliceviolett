I"‹<p>Iâ€™m coming to the end of a four-week trial of Nvivo.Â  Having tested it out, with the help of Bazeley and Jacksonâ€™s guidebook, on my notes from early-twentieth century psychology/sociology articles about only children, Iâ€™m going to keep it for my oral history and autobiography work.Â  This weekâ€™s blog is about my experiences of Nvivo, and using computers in my work in general.</p>
