<p>May was a rare month where I actually <a href="/book-blog/2019/05/01/what-i-read-in-april-2019">read everything I planned to</a>! Not that my TBR pile has shrunk a bit. Quite the opposite, in factâ€¦</p>

<p>Iâ€™m noticing some definite themes in the kinds of books I pick up: smart and unconventional teenage girls; stories-within-stories; the blending of past and present; strange goings-on; previous generationsâ€™ sins and mistakes coming to haunt the present.</p>

<p>My June plans are quite crime and non-fiction heavy! Lots of crime authors bring out their new books in the summer months, probably to catch the holiday market. I always pre-order any new Stuart MacBride book as soon as I know itâ€™s coming - his books are darkly hilarious treats. Iâ€™m really excited for the long-awaited new Jackson Brodie novel from Kate Atkinson, and the new Sarah Hilary release, <cite>Never Be Broken</cite>, sounds like an amazing addition to an awesome series.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also been waiting a long time for <cite>The Five</cite>, by Hallie Rubenhold, as I started at about 25th in the reservations queue, and <cite>Common People</cite>, edited by Kit de Waal, which I pledged for with Unbound quite a while ago now, and looks fantastic.</p>
