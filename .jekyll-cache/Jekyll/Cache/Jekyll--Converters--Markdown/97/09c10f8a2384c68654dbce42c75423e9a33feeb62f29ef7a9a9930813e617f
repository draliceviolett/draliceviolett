I"˜<p>I say itâ€™s not a survival guide because there really wasnâ€™t much <em>to</em> survive.Â  At least now I donâ€™t have to worry about future boards because I know that unless I just completely stop working or produce a horrendous paper, itâ€™s going to be OK.Â  Let this be a reassurance to future PhDs, or those who havenâ€™t had their boards yet.Â  This post is a mixture of reflection and advice.</p>
