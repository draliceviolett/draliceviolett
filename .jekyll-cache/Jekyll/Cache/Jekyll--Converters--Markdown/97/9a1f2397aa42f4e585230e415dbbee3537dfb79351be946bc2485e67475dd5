I"ã<p>Itâ€™s been a funny old month. I only managed to read three of the five books I hoped to, because I forgot quite how many books were due out. As many of them were library books, I had to prioritise reading them because other people had reservations on them!</p>

<p>There were also a couple of books I read reeeeeally slooooowly because I kept falling asleep while I was reading them - not sure what the exact proportions were of me being very tired and comfortable and them being a bit boring! I love sleeping, but I wish I could keep it to the designated time so I could read more.</p>

<p><cite>Once Upon a River</cite>, by Diane Setterfield - 5*</p>

<p><cite>Girl, Woman, Other</cite>, by Bernadine Evaristo. I wish it had been the sole winner of the Booker Prize, Iâ€™m quite angry that the first black woman winner had to share it - 5*</p>

<p><cite>River of Destiny</cite>, by Barbara Erskine. A good read, but not on a level with the other three novels of hers Iâ€™ve read as the characters were all a bit too middle-class, middle-aged and smug, so I didnâ€™t warm to them - 4*</p>

<p><cite>Nocturnes</cite>, by John Connolly - 4.5*</p>

<p><img src="/images/october-collage-2.jpg" alt="Bone China, French Exit, Night Music, The Secret Commonwealth" /></p>

<p><cite>Bone China</cite>, by Laura Purcell - 4*</p>

<p><cite>French Exit</cite>, by Patrick deWitt - 3*</p>

<p><cite>Night Music</cite>, by John Connolly - 4.5*</p>

<p><cite>The Secret Commonwealth</cite>, by Philip Pullman. An engaging story and I like Lyra as an adult, but can Malcolm please not be romantically interested in her? Thereâ€™s a huge gap between a 31-year-old professor and a 20-year-old student - 4*</p>

<p><img src="/images/october-collage-3.jpg" alt="Now You See Them, The Secret of Cold Hill, Ring the Hill, Mistletoe" /></p>

<p><cite>Now You See Them</cite>, by Elly Griffiths - 4*</p>

<p><cite>The Secret of Cold Hill</cite>, by Peter James - 4*</p>

<p><cite>Ring the Hill</cite>, by Tom Cox - 4*</p>

<p><cite>Mistletoe</cite>, by Alison Littlewood - 3*</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking aheadâ€¦</h2>

<p>Maybe if I say Iâ€™m hoping to read four particular books instead of five, I might actually manage it?</p>

<p>Halloween may be over, but scary books are forever! After reading two books of short stories from him, Iâ€™m finally launching into John Connollyâ€™s huge Charlie Parker series. <cite>Ninth House</cite> by Leigh Bardugo, meanwhile looks very intriguing, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed some of her YA titles.</p>

<p>I ran out of crime novels by Robert Bryndza to read a few months ago so Iâ€™m glad <cite>Nine Elms</cite> is finally here, and I enjoyed <cite>Diary of a Bookseller</cite> so Iâ€™m really looking forward to the second instalment of Shaun Bythellâ€™s memoirs.</p>
