I"r<p>A few years ago now, the Browne report recommended a year’s teacher training for new academics.  I thought that was really rather excessive and I still do (already spent 7/8 years training in the academy!  Only teaching for a few hours a week!  Resentment if you prefer the research side!  Would we be getting paid for this?!) but, on the other hand, I think the two days of training we get in my institution before being let loose on the students may be a little on the small side.  We actually get our teaching qualification by reflecting on practical experience rather than before we get out there and teach.</p>
