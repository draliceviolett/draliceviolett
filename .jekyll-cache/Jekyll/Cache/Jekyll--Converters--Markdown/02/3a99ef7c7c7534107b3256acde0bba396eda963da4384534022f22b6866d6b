I"–<p>Anyone can now <a href="http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/">read my thesis online</a>. I think this means Iâ€™m technically a doctor now, but Iâ€™m not going to fully believe it until I receive the letter that says so.</p>

<p>I spent some time considering whether I should embargo my thesis in case I wanted to make a book from its contents in the future. Ultimately, I decided that that was a very unlikely scenario and that Iâ€™d rather people could read it and get something from it immediately, rather than in three or five years.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d heard from a lot of people that itâ€™s a good idea to embargo your thesis because many publishers wonâ€™t accept work thatâ€™s alreadyÂ â€˜out thereâ€™. Apparently this is quite a recent development in academic publishing, and some established academics were shocked to hear about it! It certainly goes against the developing ethos of Open Access. Also, I seriously doubt it would affect the publishersâ€™ sales - why on earth would anyone choose to read a thesis if thereâ€™s a book available (providing their library had the book or the book was a reasonable priceâ€¦)?</p>

<p>My problem with the pressure to embargo in case I publish a book is that, erm, I really donâ€™t want to publish a book. Yes, I have considered that I might change my mind. But I know myself. I know Iâ€™m not going to ever be so desperate to publish a book that I will rend my garments because I didnâ€™t embargo my thesis and therefore canâ€™t get a publisher (also, Not All Publishers).</p>

<p>In fact, making my thesis Open Access could be a kindness to my future self. There were times when I was rewriting my thesis that I absolutely hated myself and my work because I didnâ€™t think anything I produced could be of high enough quality to earn me a PhD, and that I would then have to deal emotionally with having failed. The back-and-forth of the publishing world and having to rewrite that content a second time could plunge me back into those feelings. Why make myself feel like that when I have the choice not to? Right now, for once, I feel pretty good about my work because it turned out it was enough to get a PhD. I should leave it on that high.</p>

<p>I also want to leave this project behind me because itâ€™s gone on for far too long already. Quite aside from the original three years of my PhD, then three monthsâ€™ interruption and 12 monthsâ€™ referral period, I submitted for my second viva nearly eight months ago and since then, Iâ€™ve mostly been waiting: for my viva, for my viva report, for the bureaucratic machine to process that Iâ€™d passed. Iâ€™ve only actually done thesis work on a few days this year, when I was preparing for my viva and when I did my corrections (which turned out to be way less onerous than I expected).</p>

<p>Writing a book would mean not only who knows how many more months of Saturday and Sunday mornings and early afternoons writing and editing, but also, I imagine that even short-turnaround books take a while to publish as you have to wait for people to read your work, and go through various drafts and changes and proof corrections. Iâ€™m so fed up of the whole thing already, and feel as though if Iâ€™d really wanted to keep working with it, Iâ€™d have actually made some sort of move towards a book in those 7+ months of dead time between January and now, instead of sleeping in every weekend.</p>

<p>The big question Iâ€™ve been asking myself about publication, though, has been: whatâ€™s in it for me? Iâ€™m not going to make any money from it. Working on itâ€™s going to make me miserable and stop me doing fun things at weekends. Iâ€™m not staying in academia, and have been in my non-academic job for nearly two years now, so I donâ€™t need it to advance in my career. Itâ€™s publicly available in a form thatâ€™s readable enough (I donâ€™t object to people skipping the literature review and sources and methods!) in case itâ€™s of interest or even use to anyone. Itâ€™s not going to enhance my life in any way. So, whatâ€™s the point?</p>

<p>This doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not happy to be a doctor. I worked really hard for it, especially last year, and Iâ€™m rightly proud of what Iâ€™ve achieved. Iâ€™ve spent the last two years dreaming of this all being over, and that incorporates both earning the qualification and never having to work on that project ever again if I donâ€™t want to.</p>

<p>At the same time, though, being a doctor itself isnâ€™t going to make any real difference to my life. It was something I did, at first because I was trying to add meaning to my life, liked studying and couldnâ€™t get a job where I got to use my brain, and latterly because I didnâ€™t want to have wasted three years or the Â£250 Iâ€™d have lost by dropping out during term-time, or deal with how Iâ€™d feel if I gave up or failed. And now itâ€™s time to move on from that, because my priorities have changed over the past five years, and Iâ€™ve found some meaning in working for a library service instead.</p>
