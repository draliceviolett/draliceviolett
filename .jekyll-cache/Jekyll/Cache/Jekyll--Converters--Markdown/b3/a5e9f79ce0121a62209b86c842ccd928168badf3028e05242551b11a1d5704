I"=<p>Last night, I went to <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/research/profiles/lss/mollyandrews/">Professor Molly Andrews’</a> talk at the IHR, titled <strong>‘</strong><strong>Narrating the Self: Temporality, imagination and possibility’</strong> and based on her new book, <em>Narrative Imagination and Everyday Life</em>.  I must say I got a lot from the talk, and will definitely read the book (when I find out where the heck my grant’s got to, it was meant to come today!).  As she was talking, my brain was firing on all cyclinders, making connections between her ideas about the use of imagination, not only in oral testimonies but other narrative sources, and my own work.  So this blog post is about her three main points about imagination in narrative sources, and how I’ve seen them come up in my own work.</p>
