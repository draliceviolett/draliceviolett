I"¯<p>I say â€˜Autobiographies of Victoriansâ€™ because while the events the authors describe happened in Victorian times, they actually wrote them down in the 1920s/30s.Â  This is a hazard of concentrating on people BORN between 1850 and 1945ish, and whether Iâ€™ll need to amend that so I can include autobiographies actually written in Victorian times I donâ€™t know yet.Â  Iâ€™ve certainly seen some features that were common in the nineteenth century; the authors talk about their ancestors and pick out things in their early lives that they think were important in determining what they would do and how they would be as adults.Â  Iâ€™ve also noticed, curiously, that the married autobiographers have said very little about their wives (everyone Iâ€™ve read has been male so far) - theyâ€™re just not important to their life stories for whatever reason.Â  But today Iâ€™m going to reproduce a few bits of autobiographies I found funny.</p>
