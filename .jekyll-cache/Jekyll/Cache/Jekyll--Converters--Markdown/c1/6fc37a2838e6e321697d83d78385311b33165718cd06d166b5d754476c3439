I"½<p>For some people, getting a PhD is absolute hell.Â  They get unlucky with their supervisors, they canâ€™t find enough data, or have massive problems with the data they have, they have to take time off for unforeseen circumstances like illness, bereavement, or caring responsibilities, they have financial problems which cause stress and mean the PhD has to fit around full-time work, they suffer from mental illnesses as a result of the pressure and/or impostor syndrome.Â  They keep going because in spite of everything, they love their subject and really want that PhD.Â  They are the true heroes, the ones who can say they â€˜survivedâ€™ the PhD, and there needs to be more support for them.</p>
