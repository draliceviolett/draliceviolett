I"Ç<p>This week, on Monday 12th May, I took part in the annual <a href="http://www.massobs.org.uk/12may.html">Mass Observation Day</a>, when people are called upon to record everything they did during the day.Â  I did it last year, but, being a Sunday, I didnâ€™t really have much to report - I only left the house to go to Tesco!Â  This yearâ€™s was a lot more involved, so Iâ€™m going to write about my experience of being a Mass Observer for the day.</p>
