I"ó<p>This week, Iâ€™m very much back on the writing - specifically, about how only children described the their personalities as children (spoiler: they didnâ€™t fit the stereotypes and there was a lot more to determining someoneâ€™s personality than just being an only child!).Â  Before I got to write about the only children themselves, though, I had to unpack the ideas of â€˜selfâ€™ and â€˜personalityâ€™ to set the scene.Â  This sent me into the realms of psychology and philosophy.Â  Again.</p>
