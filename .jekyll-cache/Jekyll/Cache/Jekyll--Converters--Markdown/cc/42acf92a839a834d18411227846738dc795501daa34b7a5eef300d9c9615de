I"„<p>I read ten books in April, which is a little bit down on previous months, but a couple of them were slow reads. I still need to read <cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite> by Sarah Armstrong, which I had down to read in March, and <cite>All Among the Barley</cite> by Melissa Harrison, which I meant to read in April!</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t really helped myself - not only do I currently have 12 books out of the library, but I bought another five and was inspired to download a couple more on Kindle when I went to <a href="https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/skulduggery/">Skulduggery in Stowmarket</a> last Saturday.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to use my efforts to get through my TBR as an excuse for only doing one review again this month. Iâ€™ve changed the name of my book blog from â€˜Book Witteringsâ€™ to â€˜Book Thoughtsâ€™ to give myself a bit more credit for the effort I put in to my in-depth reviews.</p>

<p>As ever, this is more of a â€˜hope to readâ€™, rather than a â€˜will readâ€™ list! On top of all the books I picked up at Skulduggery, new crime fiction release season is going into full flow in May, so I could have populated the picture above with crime alone. Instead, Iâ€™ve gone for a mixture of genres - crime, gothic/historic, YA/LGBT, modern classic, and non-fiction.</p>

<p>I always pre-order a new Mark Billingham book as soon as itâ€™s announced so <cite>Their Little Secret</cite> was a shoo-in. Iâ€™ve been Michelle Paver-curious for a while, and decided to start with new release <cite>Wakenhyrst</cite>. <cite>Pulp</cite> by Robin Talley just looks plain awesome!</p>

<p>Elizabeth Goudge was one of my favourite subjects of <a href="http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/">my thesis</a> and Iâ€™ve been meaning to actually read her books for ages - plus, how gorgeous is the lino printing on that newish cover? <cite>Lowborn</cite> by Kerry Hudson looks really interesting, though Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll also make me rage with injustice!</p>
