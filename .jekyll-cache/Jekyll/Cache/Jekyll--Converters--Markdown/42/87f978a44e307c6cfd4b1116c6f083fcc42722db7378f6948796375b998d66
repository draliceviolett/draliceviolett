I"H<p>I’ve been let down a couple of times this week, simply because I only started my PhD in October.  I couldn’t go on a teaching course for people who aren’t teaching yet because it’s only for second years and upwards (even though by the time it comes around in second year I might already be teaching anyway), and I wasn’t given the travel funding I really wanted because I’m not in second or third year (the form stated they ‘usually’ give it to second and third years.  Problematic, as I will explain, but worth a shot, right?).  I don’t think this is OK.</p>
