I"<p>This week I had the opportunity to view <a href="http://www.age-exchange.org.uk/cotgw/index.html">Age Exchange’s ‘Children of the Great War’ film</a>, followed by a question-and-answer session with the film-makers.   This hour-long film was one of the results of interviews conducted with more than a hundred people about stories they had regarding their family in the First World War, a reminiscence project that also incorporated digitising thousands of war-related artefacts owned by members of the public for the <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/">Europeana archive</a>.  I enjoyed the film, and at the same time it raised questions for me about the similarities and differences between the concerns of historians and artists such as film-makers.</p>
