I"D<p>A bit of a ruckus has arisen of late about what academics wear, with articles such as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/oct/26/-sp-female-academics-dont-power-dress-forget-heels-and-no-flowing-hair-allowed">this</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/21/why-do-academics-dress-so-badly">this</a> getting a lot of attention.Â  So naturally, I started thinking more about what I wear, and whether there seem to be dress codes, and whether or not other people are thinking maybe a little too much about this issue.</p>
