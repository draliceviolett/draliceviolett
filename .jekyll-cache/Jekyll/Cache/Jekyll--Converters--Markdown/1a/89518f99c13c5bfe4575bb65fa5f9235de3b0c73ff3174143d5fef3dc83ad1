I"™<p>This week has mostly involved two books - one I loved, one I hated.Â  Iâ€™m going to talk about the one I hated first, so I can get the negativity out of the way.Â  Iâ€™ll also say less about it as I want this blog to be positive (and not like essay criticism where there seems to be a rule that the negative paragraph has to be the same length as the positive one, however minor the criticisms are!).</p>
