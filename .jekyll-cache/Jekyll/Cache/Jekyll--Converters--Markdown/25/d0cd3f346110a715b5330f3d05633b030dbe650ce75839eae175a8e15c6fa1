I"ò<p>When I was reading autobiographies, I became well-aquainted with a number of Amazon Marketplace dealers, selling what I needed for 1p (+ Â£2.80 postage and packaging).Â  The pre-loved books Iâ€™ve received have all been in readable condition, and I even want to hold on to some of them after Iâ€™ve finished because theyâ€™re interesting, look nice, or are just delightfully old.Â  A few have inscriptions and other such bits in them, which provide a small window into their previous lives.</p>
