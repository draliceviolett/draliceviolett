I"À<p>Iâ€™ve finally returned from marking hell with some (hopefully) interesting things to blog about.Â  As my other major task over the holidays was to write a paper for a conference Iâ€™m speaking at next week (and I see other conferences on the horizon), and blog posts and conference papers are two of my favourite things to write, I thought it would be fun to write a post comparing them.</p>

<p>**They can both be fairly easy to â€˜knock outâ€™.Â  **It takes me AGES to do a formal piece of academic writing.Â  Iâ€™ll be putting my research into words for the first time, and I have to get across all the things I want to say in the right way, and sometimes itâ€™ll be the first time Iâ€™m using particular sources, so I have to type out full references (yes, Iâ€™m too old-fashioned to use this newfangled referencing software.Â  And dammit, I like the <em>control</em>).Â  My conference papers tend to be things Iâ€™ve already written about, so the material is there, it just needs to be put into a different format.Â  Sometimes Iâ€™ll blog about new research, but while I always reference in blogs, I know itâ€™s not going to be judged in the same way as, for example, a board paper, and make it clear that my findings are preliminary.Â  And I donâ€™t remember anyone apart from myself pulling me up for careless typos on my blog.Â  Blogs are fast.Â  Academic writing is slow.</p>

<p>**You donâ€™t need to use massively formal language in either.Â  **Blogs especially are a good place to express your own â€˜voiceâ€™ outside the formal, starched language of academia.Â  I use colloquialisms and give my opinions on my blog.Â  With conference papers, you do have to use a reasonable standard of language, but at the same time you donâ€™t want to alienate your audience by sounding like a particularly posh robot.Â  I use contractions as theyâ€™re part of normal speech, and throw in the occasional aside to keep things human and friendly.</p>

<p>**Conference papers require more editing.Â  **Itâ€™s pretty damn hard to write a conference paper thatâ€™s exactly the right length right away.Â  The one Iâ€™ve recently written started out way too long as I was giving far too much information about something a bit too far from the point of the paper, so a lot of that had to go.Â  Also, because Iâ€™d written parts of it on different days, there were repetitions that needed removing.Â  In my initial run-throughs I was constantly asking myself, â€˜do the audience need to know this?â€™ â€˜is this boring?â€™ and â€˜are there enough breaks in this sentence so I donâ€™t run out of breath?â€™.Â  Iâ€™m extremely unlikely to need to read a blog post out loud, thereâ€™s no performance to judge, so I just need to give it a quick proofread and itâ€™s good to go.I might not even look at a blog post again once itâ€™s done, whereas I try to finish writing a paper way ahead of time so I can practice it to death.Â  I will see all of that paperâ€™s flaws.</p>

<p>**Conference papers get more feedback, but blog posts are more permanent.Â  **Unless, of course, they make your conference talk into a podcast, though thatâ€™s no guarantee that people will actually listen to it.Â  People at conferences, by virtue of being there in person and having a Q&amp;A session, are more obliged to think of things to say to you about your research, whereas often people just look at my blog posts for a couple of minutes - I know theyâ€™re there, but they donâ€™t say anything!Â  However, generally, once a conference is done, itâ€™s done - other conferences and papers come along, you make improvements, previous conferences become a hazy memory.Â  Blog posts are a bit more permanent.Â  Some of my blog posts donâ€™t have a lasting readership.Â  Others, I notice, still attract readers as new people discover my blog and take their pick of old posts that take their fancy.</p>

<p>Wish me luck with my paper!</p>
