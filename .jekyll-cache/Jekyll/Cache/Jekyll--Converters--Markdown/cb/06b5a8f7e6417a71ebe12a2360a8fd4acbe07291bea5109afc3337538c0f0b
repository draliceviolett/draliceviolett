I"<p>Just as my work has turned up mostly only children who didnâ€™t fit the only-child stereotypes - particularly that they were loners, socially awkward and didnâ€™t have any friends, or precocious because they were too indulged by their parents - Iâ€™ve found a number of non-only children in my control group who actually fitted the stereotype in certain ways.Â  There were various reasons for this: having a sibling was not a guarantee of good company, individual personality influenced by both genes and environment, and, in my opinion very importantly, treatment by parents.Â  Iâ€™m going to talk about four people who were particularly only-ish.</p>
