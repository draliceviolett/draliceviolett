I"b<h2>PhD and beyond</h2>

<p>This section of my website was initially intended to be an archive of the blog posts I wrote throughout my PhD, what with Tumblr shedding users all over the place. However, my thesis has turned out to be the gift that keeps on giving (content), so now it’s called ‘PhD and beyond’.</p>

<p>My thesis is <a href="http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22943/"><cite>The Public Perceptions and Personal Experience of Only Children, c. 1850-1950</cite></a> and took just under five years, which was two years longer than planned. The first three years were suspiciously easy, the unexpected fourth year was not, and I spent most of the fifth year waiting for the wheels of bureaucracy to turn.</p>

<p>I’m very slowly cleaning up <a href="https://aliceinacademia.tumblr.com">my old posts</a> so that they show up properly on here (it’s happening so slowly because it’s an incredibly tedious task). I’m weeding out unnecessary images (mostly because I can’t be bothered to copy <em>everything</em> into my images folder) and reblogs (don’t really work as a concept outside of Tumblr).</p>
