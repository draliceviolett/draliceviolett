I"{<p>I read 11 non-fiction, crime and thriller, fantasy and historical fiction books in February, yet my TBR list never gets any smaller. I had lots of reservations come through, with more arriving soon, and Iâ€™m always spotting books I like the look of. My next read is <cite>This is Going to Hurt</cite>, by Adam Kay, several months after virtually everyone else read it!</p>

<p><img src="/images/february-collage-4.jpg" alt="The Glass Woman, All Out, Potkin and Stubbs, The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy, The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt" /></p>

<p>I do love a bit of Gothic/scary historical fiction (I absolutely devoured <cite>The Familiars, by Stacey Halls</cite> this week, and <cite>The Corset</cite>, by Laura Purcell, was one of <a href="/book-blog/2019/01/02/best-of-2018/">my favourite books of 2018</a>) so Iâ€™m really looking forward to getting my hands on <cite>The Glass Woman</cite>, by Caroline Lea. And how beautiful is that cover?!</p>

<p>I picked up <cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite>, by Sarah Armstrong, at her author event at <a href="http://www.redlionbooks.co.uk/">Red Lion Books</a> last month and havenâ€™t had time to read it yet, so itâ€™s near the top of my TBR list.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I gave Mackenzi Leeâ€™s <cite>The Gentlemanâ€™s Guide to Vice and Virtue</cite> five stars last month, so I have high expectations of the sequel, <cite>The Ladyâ€™s Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</cite>. Lee is also one of the authors who have contributed a short story to <cite>All Out: the no longer secret stories of queer teens throughout the ages</cite>, edited by Saundra Mitchell, which drew me in with its gorgeous cover and snagged me with its promise of LGBT short stories set across a wide range of historical settings.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m really excited to read Sophie Greenâ€™s first childrenâ€™s book, <cite>Potkin &amp; Stubbs</cite>, and not just because we work together! A journalist helping a ghost investigate their own death, with noir and comedy elements? Sign me up! And donâ€™t tell me Iâ€™m â€˜too oldâ€™ for middle grade booksâ€¦</p>

<p>I mentioned in <a href="/book-blog/2019/02/01/what-i-read-in-january-2019/">last monthâ€™s round-up</a> that I was looking forward to reading <cite>The Stone Circle</cite>, by Elly Griffiths, this month, but my reservation didnâ€™t come through in time! Itâ€™s in transit now, though, so hopefully Iâ€™ll be reading it very soon.</p>
