I"j<p>Another month of 2019 down! And once again, I haven’t managed to write any reviews… but I did write a <a href="/phd-archive/2019/07/21/i-graduated">blog post about graduating from my PhD</a>. My PhD blog posts get a lot more traction than my book ones, but I really do have no PhD left to write about - the one downside of finally getting the thing out of my life.</p>

<p>I wasn’t expecting ancient Welsh king Glendower (or his poet, Iolo) to be such a theme of my reading this month - I’d come across him in the first two books of Maggie Stiefvater’s Raven Cycle, and then he unexpectedly popped up in the amazing <cite>Sleeper’s Castle</cite>, by Barbara Erskine. He felt a bit like an old friend when I returned to the Raven Cycle not long after that!</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead…</h2>

<p>I’m hoping to finish Elizabeth Goudge’s Eliot Chronicles with <cite>The Heart of the Family</cite> this month, and I really should sit myself down and write a blog post about this series - I have a few thoughts about it and can bring in what I know about the author from my PhD.</p>

<p>Ruth Ware and Val McDermid are authors whose books I’ll reserve/order as soon as I hear about them. <cite>How the Dead Speak</cite> will land on my Kindle right at the end of the month, on the 29th, but I tend to drop everything to read a new Val McDermid title, so I’m pretty likely to read the whole thing while it’s still August.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my love affair with Maggie Stiefvater and Barbara Erskine shows no signs of abating. Good thing I still have quite a few (OK, absolutely loads in Barbara Erskine’s case) of their books to get through!</p>
