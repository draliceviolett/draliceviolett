I"¯<p>When I was reading autobiographies, I became well-aquainted with a number of Amazon Marketplace dealers, selling what I needed for 1p (+ Â£2.80 postage and packaging).Â  The pre-loved books Iâ€™ve received have all been in readable condition, and I even want to hold on to some of them after Iâ€™ve finished because theyâ€™re interesting, look nice, or are just delightfully old.Â  A few have inscriptions and other such bits in them, which provide a small window into their previous lives.</p>

<p>Some have dates of acquisition, either written by the owner or the gifter of the book.Â  These werenâ€™t necessarily the original, or only, owners of these books; the one from 1944 comes from the third edition of Sir Charles Omanâ€™s <em>Memories of Victorian Oxford</em>, published in 1942, and, as we shall see further down, also featured three layers of _ex libris _plates.Â  The one from 2003 was actually from this book, published in 1934:</p>

<p>I wonder what Veronicaâ€™s interest in Lord Berners was?Â  Or maybe she just collected books that werenâ€™t allowed in the British Empire.</p>

<p>Some books just have nice old plates in them.Â  The second one of these is the one that ended up with Sheila in 1944.Â  There are three layers of plates; the top two are stuck fast and would probably take whatâ€™s underneath with them, so best to leave them than investigate I think.Â  Pretty sure the one at the bottom is a library one, detailing fines.</p>

<p>I like the ones that have WHSmith Library gubbins in them.Â  Itâ€™s like having a little piece of history.</p>

<p>This was even signed by the author, who I mention a few times in my thesis!Â  Although, being a reformed convict, James Nelson was a pseudonym.</p>

<p>And then there was the time I found what seems to be a letter, apparently complaining about university.Â  Hard to figure out the year - the writer mentions internet dating sites, but writing letters is still a thing.Â  I canâ€™t remember exactly whose autobiography I found it in, alas, but the tone of the letter was incongruous with it.Â  The writer finds the men in the department â€˜sad and madâ€™ but the women who work in the department office are lovely, smiley, and efficient.Â  The older staff membersâ€™ rooms feature posters of things like molecules, others â€˜like students, again â€¦ have these weird, mannered crushes on, get this, Sarah Brightman â€¦ the dark-haired one (!) from Abba â€¦ [another] has a picture of someone called Selina Scott on his wall, I dunno who she is.â€™Â  As a student, he thinks he has more of a chance with the ladies than the staff do, and he writes a fair bit about his dad being on the staff.Â  I knew the skills I picked up deciphering the old recipe books wouldnâ€™t go to waste!</p>
