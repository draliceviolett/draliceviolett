I"ª<p>Itâ€™s getting towards that time of year when people start putting PhD applications together, and thinking about how theyâ€™re going to get the money to do a PhD.Â  When I applied two years ago, you needed an offer of a PhD place to apply for funding, and deadlines for this varied from end of January and end of March, and I doubt this has changed much.Â  Applications mean extra research and writing and revising a proposal several times over, so I would definitely recommend starting around now and making the most of the Christmas break to make your application perfect.Â  I got AHRC funding, which is ridiculously competitive, so hopefully my advice is worth something!</p>
