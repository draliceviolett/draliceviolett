I"˜<p>For the past three weeks, Iâ€™ve been diligently reading through Mass Observation Records - namely the 1944 Family Survey, where Mass Observers went round peopleâ€™s houses and asked them about their family size and feelings about the future (and sometimes judged how attractive the mothers were and how clean and fat/thin the children were!) and the 1949 â€˜Ideal Familyâ€™ Survey, which was sent out to panel members by post and given out by doctors and asked people what their opinions on the ideal family size, sex balance and spacing, and why.Â  My online subscription runs out next Thursday, so itâ€™s been my main focus as Iâ€™ve tried to read as much as I can while I can!Â  I thought Iâ€™d share here some of the things that really jumped out at me.</p>

<p><strong>Most people thought the ideal family was made up of four children.</strong>Â  These days, pretty much everyone would regard that as a large family, but a lot of the respondents regarded it as the most that could be afforded before the children lost out on attention/essentials/the mum was run completely ragged.Â  Different times indeed!Â  I came across several comments that suggested that two or even three children didnâ€™t constitute a â€˜properâ€™ or â€˜realâ€™ family.Â  Furthermore, most of these respondents wanted equal numbers of boys and girls, which is fair enough, but a lot of the time they also wanted gaps of 1-2 years between each child (some were sensible and put a longer gap between the two sets of two children).Â  Two (surprisingly, female) respondents thought that two sets of boy-girl twins with two years between them was ideal.[1]Â  Four children under three might be great for the kids but Iâ€™m not sure many adults, even at the time, would have agreed with that!Â  One respondent - also female! - harked back to Victorian times by recommending 12 children, seven boys and five girls: â€˜the elders would help the youngers and earn, with several incomes to one roofâ€™ â€¦ â€˜The only solution I can see to labour/wealth problems and home-help problemsâ€™.[2]</p>

<p><strong>People still held questionable</strong>Â <strong>views</strong><strong>. Â </strong>The eugenics movement was pretty much dead in 1949 what with it being too close to Nazi views for comfort, but unfortunately it had left its mark.Â  The nicer respondents gave the â€˜unfitâ€™ a choice in their sterilisation; the less-nice said it should be compulsory.Â  The â€˜ideal family questionnaireâ€™ also asked whether peopleâ€™s ideal family sizes differed depending on whether a family was from the middle-class or working-class, town or country.Â  Most said less for the working-class on the rational basis that they might not be able to afford more; others gave a eugenic reason for it.Â  My favourite answer was from a rogue socialist who said the middle classes should have none so that they would die out - the same respondent was a keen supporter of the one-child family, but only as a population reduction measure, believed that multiple births should be â€˜shared outâ€™, and lamented that contraception wasnâ€™t compulsory.[3]Â  Her survey certainly made for something different to read!Â  Some anti-Catholicism reared its head too, with some respondents saying their ideal family size wouldnâ€™t be easily achieved by the population at large because Catholic families exceeded it.</p>

<p>**Virtually nobody liked only children.Â  **For one thing, there were lots of negative comments about only children, usually in the section of the â€˜ideal familyâ€™ survey where they were asked to justify their ideal family size.Â  Sometimes, respondents were very superlative in their answers without actually giving reasons; examples of this included â€˜an only child is a criminal offence against that childâ€™, â€˜An only child is a horrible mistakeâ€™, â€˜the worst thing that can happen to any kid is to be the only oneâ€™, and simply, â€˜it is wrong to have an only childâ€™.[4]Â  Other times, they actually gave proper reasons; â€˜spoiltâ€™ â€˜selfishâ€™ and â€˜socially maladjustedâ€™ came up countless times (I will actually have to count them eventually, but for a blog knocked out on a Friday night, â€˜countlessâ€™ will do).Â </p>

<p>Some of these respondents even gave psychology as a justification for their answers, showing how psychological ideas infiltrated everyday thinking, which is actually quite important and useful for my thesis.Â  A few examples of this are: â€˜the only one or the only one of that sex is apt to be psychologically dangerous to health &amp; happiness from over coddling or parental anxietyâ€™; â€˜If there must be children at all, I think the only child should be avoided.Â  The obvious psychological handicap for it can be removed but usually notâ€™; â€˜Parents over worry when there are one or two children + this is not good psychologically for children, parents, or the future of the nation which these children will formâ€™.[5]Â </p>

<p>My favourites were the people who gave a bit of their own experience of being only children to justify their answer - not only have I found useful stuff for the â€˜perceptionsâ€™ part of my thesis from these sources, but something for the â€˜actual experiences of only childrenâ€™ bit!Â  A few examples are: â€˜I am an only child, and know a little of the loneliness of that child, as many contemporary friends of school days were also only children; we all loathed itâ€™, â€˜I am an only child, can say from experience it is a most unpleasant childhood.Â  So one child is not sufficientâ€™, and â€˜the one child idea is very mistaken kindness on the part of the parents.Â  I know it to my costâ€™.[6]</p>

<p>For another thing, when people actually recommended only children as â€˜idealâ€™, or had one and werenâ€™t planning on having any more, it was generally for negative reasons: often, people <em>resigned</em> themselves or the population in general to having one child, due to: overpopulation, lack of money, disruption caused by the Second World War, personal infertility or health problems that made it inadvisable to have children, bad birth experiences, difficulties of handling the existing child, housing difficulties, separation/divorce, and a general sense of pessimism about the future.[7]Â  Very few, in other words, made the choice to have one child because of any advantages for that child; it was very much â€˜why we didnâ€™t have more childrenâ€™ rather than â€˜why we had one and decided it would be good to stop thereâ€™.</p>

<p>So, thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been up to recently.Â  I have 6 days left to get a much more as I possibly can from these sources.Â  I wish I had more permanent access to the collections, but thatâ€™s mostly out of geeky curiosity than any benefit to my actual thesis!</p>
