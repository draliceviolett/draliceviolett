I"þ<p>For the past three weeks, Iâ€™ve been diligently reading through Mass Observation Records - namely the 1944 Family Survey, where Mass Observers went round peopleâ€™s houses and asked them about their family size and feelings about the future (and sometimes judged how attractive the mothers were and how clean and fat/thin the children were!) and the 1949 â€˜Ideal Familyâ€™ Survey, which was sent out to panel members by post and given out by doctors and asked people what their opinions on the ideal family size, sex balance and spacing, and why.Â  My online subscription runs out next Thursday, so itâ€™s been my main focus as Iâ€™ve tried to read as much as I can while I can!Â  I thought Iâ€™d share here some of the things that really jumped out at me.</p>
