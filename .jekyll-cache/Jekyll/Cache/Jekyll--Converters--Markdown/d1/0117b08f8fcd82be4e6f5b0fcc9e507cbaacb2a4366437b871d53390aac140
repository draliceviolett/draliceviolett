I"P<p>The reading of Victorians’ autobiographies so far has been a very male-centred activity.  There’s no mystery as to why - men got to do more interesting things than women, and were probably more likely to think their experiences were worth writing about, too.  This week, I got to read the autobiographies of two only-child actresses - Julia Neilson (1868-1957) and Nancy Price (1880-1970).  Despite the twelve-year age gap (and the almost identical gap between the publication of their autobiographies), it’s pretty likely that they crossed paths as they moved in the same circles, though I can’t find any conclusive evidence to back that up.  They had in common that rare thing - being allowed to continue working on the stage after marriage - and that’s probably how they amassed enough experiences to write autobiographies.</p>
