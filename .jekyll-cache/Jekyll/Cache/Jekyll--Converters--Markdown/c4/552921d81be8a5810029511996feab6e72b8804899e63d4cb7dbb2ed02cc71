I"v<p>There are two questions I commonly get asked.  The first, unsurprisingly, is: ‘are you an only child?’, the answer to which is ‘yes’.  Another, less frequent but nonetheless pertinent one is ‘how will you avoid putting your own spin on things in your thesis?’  I don’t see it as too much of a problem myself, but I can see why it might be a concern.</p>
