I"h<p>I’ve finally read all the control group autobiographies and listened to all the control group oral histories, so now I can concentrate on something I personally find a lot more fun and stimulating - actually analysing my data!  In the last few days I’ve been using Nvivo to code the last of the autobiographies and put together my Social History Society conference paper.  Some people like it for the charts and graphics you can produce with it, but I prefer to use it as a practical digital alternative to highlighters and sticky labels.  So what have I been doing with Nvivo and the autobiographies?</p>
