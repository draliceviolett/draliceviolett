I"<p>Every now and again, you come across an autobiographer or oral history interviewee you find objectionable to some extent or another.  You’re happily reading or listening along and then BANG, they advocate a bizarre one-child policy in Britain, criticise the Church of England for having the gall to take the views of minorities into account (with the conjunctive use of the terms ‘gay marriage’ and ‘unnatural lives’), or say that women shouldn’t go out to work (all actual examples).  You have to keep going, because you haven’t quite finished compiling their only-child experiences, but you’re less inclined to be sympathetic with them.  You also have to keep an eye out for any unintentional bias you might use against them when you’re analysing and writing up.</p>
