I"<p>I couldn’t think what to write about this week, as I haven’t really done much of note lately.  I’ve been recovering from all the writing, practicing my talk, going to the BL and discovering Ann Oakley (the feminist sociologist, not the shooter), who is my new favourite person - not only interesting and entertaining in her writing, but useful for my thesis too!  So I decided to try to do a Q&amp;A.  I got two responses, which was two more than I expected, and one of them contained multiple questions.  So yay!</p>
