I"ë<p>A lot of the literature Iâ€™ve come across, old and new, suggests that only children are/were rather hopeless at team sports, largely on the basis that by not experiencing â€˜rough and tumbleâ€™ with other children and fair, consistent rules at home before they started school, they were â€˜unclubbableâ€™, timid, and resisted games that they didnâ€™t have a higher-than-average chance of winning.Â  My preliminary research using autobiographies shows that while some only children did have this experience, a substantial number reported that they enjoyed school sports, or otherwise had mixed experiences of them.Â  Additionally, some sibling children had negative experiences of school sports that echoed those expected of only children.</p>
