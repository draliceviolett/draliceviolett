I"’<p>A bit of a ruckus has arisen of late about what academics wear, with articles such as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/oct/26/-sp-female-academics-dont-power-dress-forget-heels-and-no-flowing-hair-allowed">this</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/21/why-do-academics-dress-so-badly">this</a> getting a lot of attention.Â  So naturally, I started thinking more about what I wear, and whether there seem to be dress codes, and whether or not other people are thinking maybe a little too much about this issue.</p>

<p>Going by the articles, I think historians are under less pressure to dress a certain way than academics from other disciplines.Â  Iâ€™ve certainly never felt the need to wear a sharp suit to a conference or for teaching, and Iâ€™m not sure if I would even go that far for an academic interview - maybe a nice shirt and a smart skirt or trousers.Â  At a history conference youâ€™ll see a wide range of styles, although Iâ€™ve only ever seen men wear jeans and t-shirts at them.Â  I did once consider it myself - I thought about wearing my Marcie t-shirt so people from Twitter would identify me - but the thing I like about conferences is the chance to dress up, and I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a gender thing or not (Iâ€™ll come back to that in a bit).Â  I donâ€™t think anyone would really be put out by it.Â  In her article, Francesca Stavrakopoulou mentions how women in her field are recommended to wear clothes that attract no attention whatsoever - whereas Iâ€™ve been given the opposite advice by a colleague, who told me that historians wear standout accessories so that when there are a load of people at a conference, you can remember new people better!</p>

<p>L-R: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.Â  Fridayâ€™s t-shirt says â€˜because badass time-travelling goddess isnâ€™t an official majorâ€™ on the back.</p>

<p>As a bit of an experiment, this baby academic took selfies every working day this week to show what I wear (I know Iâ€™m not the thinnest person in the world, LOOK AT THE CLOTHES DAMMIT).Â  As you can see, on Monday, Tuesday and today Iâ€™ve been pretty casual, and thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve mostly been working from home - on Monday I popped out for lunch, but on Tuesday and today I didnâ€™t go out/donâ€™t plan to go out (other than for the gym before I got dressed in â€˜properâ€™ clothes), hence the slippers. Slippers aside, this is the type of thing I would wear to the library or department when I need to study on campus.</p>

<p>On Wednesday and Thursday, I was teaching.Â  I like to â€˜dress upâ€™ a bit for teaching.Â  Thatâ€™s not because our department has any written rules about it, and I have colleagues who teach in more casual clothes, and thatâ€™s absolutely fine.Â  Itâ€™s not about placing myself above the students really.Â  Itâ€™s more that, because I wear casual clothes so much of the time for days when Iâ€™m just reading and writing, itâ€™s nice to have an excuse to wear â€˜nicerâ€™ clothes.Â  Iâ€™m not sure if this is a gender thing when there might be men out there who like dressing up a bit when theyâ€™re teaching for the same reason.Â  The same goes for conferences - theyâ€™re a convenient opportunity for me to wear â€˜niceâ€™ clothes as theyâ€™re â€˜officialâ€™ events, and aside from aesthetic interest (I am susceptible to shoe and dress envy!), it doesnâ€™t bother me what other people choose to wear to them.Â  I actually wore Wednesdayâ€™s outfit to the conference I spoke at last week.Â  I do wear heels sometimes (but I only find the chunky 90s-school-shoe style tolerably comfortable), but I donâ€™t feel obliged to because Iâ€™m a woman.Â  In the same vein, I only really wear lipstick on special occasions, not because I feel itâ€™s necessary for a woman to do so, but because itâ€™s a treat when thereâ€™s so little point wearing it to just sit at home or in the library with a book.Â  Is this the result of some ingrained social conditioning?Â  I have absolutely no idea.Â  I just want to feel reasonably attactive when I go places (to myself rather than other people, compliments just make me feel awkward), and like Iâ€™ve made an effort.Â </p>

<p>Unless I undergo a complete change in personal style preferences, these are the types of clothes I would wear every day if I became a proper academic - or, for that matter, worked anywhere that called for a smart casual look.Â  Iâ€™m not sure that debates over workwear, especially how women dress, are that particular to academia.</p>

<p>I actually gave a presentation to my students this week about how to do a good presentation.Â  I had a section about appearance in which I told them that I donâ€™t like telling people what to wear any more than I like being told what to wear (I would feel very affronted if someone told me to tie my hair back like in the article, not least because I personally hate how I look with my hair tied back and would not feel confident!), as long as they assess the occasion.Â  Itâ€™s common sense, though, that you wouldnâ€™t wear pyjamas to a job interview, for instance, and wearing a t-shirt with a provocative slogan is fine on a normal day, but not when everyoneâ€™s going to be looking at you and trying to concentrate on what youâ€™re saying.Â  But the world would be extremely boring to look at if everyone dressed the same.</p>
