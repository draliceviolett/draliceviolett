I"E<p>So, more things were going to happen this week, but then they didn’t because of <strong>strikes</strong>.  In both cases I support the strikes (London Underground and university staff) but I have less to write about than I planned.  I did, however, go to an enlightening <strong>talk on imposter syndome</strong> and do/read <strong>a couple of interesting things</strong>, so I’ll blog about those.</p>

<p>Ever since I first heard the name for them, I’ve recognised myself as having <strong>imposter feelings</strong> - as distinct from <strong>imposter syndrome</strong>, where the fear of being exposed as a fraud influences your behaviour.  The most obvious example of this is my having received <strong>AHRC funding</strong> for my PhD.  Everyone talks about how prestigious it is, and rather than agreeing that yes, I must have done an extremely good application, I always think that <strong>there can’t have been much competition and they had to give the money to someone</strong> or <strong>they’ll regret giving me the money when they find out I can’t deliver</strong>.</p>

<p>But I’ve thought about it, and I’ve actually had such feelings in other areas of <strong>my life</strong>.  The earliest example I can think of is the <strong>11+</strong> - which I passed, catapulting me from being a <strong>big fish in **</strong>a small pond** to a** small fish in a big pond<strong>.  Suddenly, I was **average or below</strong> and <strong>hardly ever got praised for my work</strong>, and for seven years I thought that my passing the 11+ was a <strong>fluke</strong>, or that <strong>my intelligence peaked when I was 11</strong> <strong>and it was all downhill from there</strong>.</p>

<p>I also feel like I’m only <strong>imitating an adult</strong>.  My feelings about adulthood have already been better explained by <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/this-is-why-ill-never-be-adult.html">this amazing famous blog post</a>.  Every now and again, I feel like a <strong>proper adult</strong>, but then those feelings fade, and I think the fact I tend to congratulate myself when I do/say something mature or manage to <strong>run the household</strong> in my parents’ absence without it burning down or being burgled or something terrible happening to the cat demonstrates that <strong>I’m not really an adult</strong>.  It’s also part of the reason that at 25 I’ve never had a driving lesson - <strong>I refuse to believe that anyone considers me mature enough to be allowed to drive a car</strong>.  Silly, when you see some of the idiots on the roads - but that’s another thing that puts me off.  Driving seems like a good way to get killed!  As well as being <strong>ideologically opposed to marriage</strong>, I also feel like I’m not really mature enough - <strong>children can’t get married</strong>.  And don’t get me started on the topic of <strong>having children</strong>.</p>

<p>Going back to <strong>academic life</strong>, my <strong>first supervisory board</strong> was one of the things that got postponed by the strikes, and now it’s not until <strong>February 27th</strong>.  My supervisor and I had both wanted it earlier than that, but for different reasons - I said to him that I <strong>just wanted it out of the way</strong> and he reminded me that <strong>it’s supportive and not a trial</strong>.  I think there’s a big difference between how students and lecturers see boards - for students, there’s a chance they might <strong>hate everything you’ve done</strong> and <strong>realise that you shouldn’t be **</strong>doing the course after all<strong>.  And even if you get through one board, **they might find you out at the next one</strong>.</p>

<p>The speaker on Wednesday defined imposter feeling as <strong>“the feeling of having misrepresented yourself despite objective evidence to the contrary”</strong>.  I have all sorts of qualification certificates, good references and a house that is still standing, but my brain discounts all that and makes excuses like <strong>“it was easy, they do say A Levels are getting easier” **or </strong>“I only <em>just</em> got a<strong>** First”</strong>.  Things is, unless you’re a narcissist, there’s no such thing as <em>feeling</em> clever - to you, you’re just <strong>doing you</strong><strong>r job</strong> and <strong>getting on with things at a</strong><strong>n average rate</strong>.  With me, <strong>chronic low self-esteem</strong> also comes into it.  Topically, I’ve read in books about <strong>only children</strong> that we find it difficult to become adults - see <a href="http://t.co/3eQ7DcRV0n">last week’s blog</a> about being on the threshold, for example. But the good news is <strong>it’s normal to have imposter feelings from time to time</strong> (most of the time it’s at the back of my mind and I do expect to get through this PhD, or at least have a good crack at it) and <strong>it’s better than being a narcissist</strong>.</p>

<p>So, what else did I do this week?  Well, I helped set up the website/blog and Facebook and Twitter pages for the <a href="http://colchesterwomen.wordpress.com">Colchester Women’s Oral History Project</a>.  I’m pushing this again because we need <strong>interviewees</strong> (aged around 60 and over and having lived in Colchester for a significant amount of time) and <strong>transcribers</strong> (accurate ones).</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m currently reading <em>Flappers</em> by Judith Mackrell.  Once again, something I’m reading for fun has ended up relating to my work - one of the women Mackrell writes about, <strong>Nancy Cunard</strong>, was an <strong>only child</strong> and had problems as a result - not least because her <strong>upper-class parents were so distant</strong>, making her <strong>espe</strong><strong>cially lonely in childhood</strong>.  Can’t wait to read the next section about her.  It’s also topical because I’m going to the <strong>University History Society’s Speakeasy Party</strong> tonight, dressed as a <strong>flapper</strong> of course.</p>
