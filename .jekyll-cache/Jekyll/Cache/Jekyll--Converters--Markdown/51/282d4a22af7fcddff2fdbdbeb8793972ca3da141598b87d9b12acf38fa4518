<p>This has been a pretty popular blog post going around - 500 hits in 3 days according to <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahRoseCrook">the author</a>.  Unsurprising really - it’s a nice little post with simple advice for stressed PhDs, and this time of year, when it’s gloomy and supervisory boards are on the horizon, is right when we need it. </p>

<p>I’m pleased that I’m already doing some of the emotionally healthy things recommended - I go to the gym most days, I see friends, I take weekends off, I took a break after being slain by a particularly boring monograph. </p>

<p>But I am guilty of feeling, er, guilty when I don’t think I’ve done enough work.  Even though there’s no use trying to work if I’ve got a splitting headache, can’t keep my eyes open or (as happened yesterday) I can’t read and take notes and blow my nose all at the same time.  I’m still banging my head against a brick wall somewhat with my attempt at a journal article - cutting a few words out of it and starting to work on another section of it was a minor victory today. </p>

<p>It’s another victory that I’ve learnt to cut my work into manageable bits.  With the journal article, I’m just going to work on it a bit at a time when I can bring myself to, and eventually it’ll be done.  When I get a piece of writing back and there are loads of corrections I feel overwhelmed and sometimes paralysed at first, but I’ve learnt to separate it into ‘minor things that can be corrected now’, ‘things that need a bit of work but I already have the research done’ and ‘things I need to read x for, y for, z for’.  Makes it a lot less scary.</p>

<p>Whilst not feeling like I’m competing with my fellow PhDs, I do sometimes worry I’m doing less work than everyone else - then I remind myself that I’m on track with deadlines and my supervisor isn’t lamenting that my bibliography is too small - so I’m clearly doing something right.  Besides which, next month I start transcribing a whole load of oral histories at the BL - I don’t think I’ll feel I’m not working hard enough then!</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m not sure how possible it would even be to be researching solidly.  In a more ‘normal’ job, some tasks become fairly automatic after a while, freeing up your brain a bit, whereas with research you need to be fairly ‘on’ all the time, which takes a lot of energy.  I can read documents for a few hours and feel more tired than I did after 8 hours working in a supermarket.</p>

<p>While people say doing a PhD can be dangerous to your mental health, I’ve been at the other end of the scale - in jobs so dull I was despairing from the boredom and lack of prospects.  I’m not much of a risk-taker, but this is one risk I’m happy I’m taking.  I’d rather be stimulated and depressed than bored and depressed.</p>
