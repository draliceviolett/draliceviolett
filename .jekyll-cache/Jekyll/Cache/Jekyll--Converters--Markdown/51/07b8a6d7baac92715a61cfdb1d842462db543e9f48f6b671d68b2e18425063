I"	<p>Make no mistake - I’m a dyed-in-the-wool, card-carrying introvert.  I’m the person who relates to all the fridge-magnet pictures on Facebook and cartoons on Tumblr about finding social interaction exhausting and needing to hide in my cave sometimes, while not necessarily being ‘shy’.  But my chosen career path requires me to teach, network and speak at conferences, so I can’t hide all the time.  And you know what?  Even though I’m wiped out by these activities, I’m not <em>bad</em> at them.</p>
