I"K<p>This week I mainly read <em>Born To Rebel</em>, by Frank J. Sulloway.  I probably should have read it a lot earlier, but I didn’t know it existed before, which was kind of prohibitive.  Anyway, Sulloway spent 20 years collecting and analysing biographical data about people like scientists and politicians, and found out that, in the main, firstborns tend to be conservative in their outlook, whereas laterborns tend towards radicalism in a bid to carve out their own niche in the family and avoid ‘being kicked out of the nest’ (basically, it’s a Darwinian theory).  He also gave a whole bunch of circumstances which create exceptions to this rule, such as age gaps and radical parents (firstborns ally themselves with their parents, apparently).  He didn’t say much about only children, apart from that they’re wildcards who can go either way.  I can get on board with that one, but despite all the mathematic proofs he gave for the firstborns and lastborns, I spent a lot of the book feeling quite critical and thinking ‘I don’t think I can get on board with this.’</p>
