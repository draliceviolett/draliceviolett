I"2<p>Today and tomorrow mark the culmination of nine months of hard work by me and my PhD buddy Nicolle.  No,we’re not having a baby - we’re having a conference, which I’m pretty sure is just as joyful and stressful.  It’s called ‘Myth and Popular Memory’ (#mythpop if you’re on Twitter), and hopefully it will be wonderful (if I post about some other subject next week, you’ll know I’m too traumatised to talk about it).  There have been some things I’ve liked about organising a conference, and some things I’ve not enjoyed so much.</p>
