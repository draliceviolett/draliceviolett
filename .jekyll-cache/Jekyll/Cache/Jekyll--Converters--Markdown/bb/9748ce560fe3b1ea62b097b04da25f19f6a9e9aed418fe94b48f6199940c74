I"¥<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: My viva isnâ€™t until tomorrow, so I have no knowledge of whether the preparation described in this post works.</strong></p>

<p>For the past week and a half, Iâ€™ve been meticulously going over all my knowledge about my thesis in order to be ready for anything my examiners throw at me.Â  As this thesis has basically been my life for the past three years, and Iâ€™ve adapted the information into umpteen blog posts, articles, and conference talks, I feel like I should know it, really - but I didnâ€™t want to be cocky and/or have a bad viva.Â  Even now, Iâ€™m thinking â€˜what if it all falls out of my head as soon as I walk into the room?â€™Â  This post is about how Iâ€™ve prepared for my viva.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I attended a workshop at my university called â€˜Surviving The Vivaâ€™, which demystified the process and gave us advice on how to prepare.Â  I used this as the basis for my preparations, making a to-do list from the information we were given:</p>

<p>(I later added â€˜plan answers to questionsâ€™ to the list).Â  That bit on the bottom left in the blue cloud is advice on creating a short thesis guide so that I had all the main points to hand:</p>

<p>I made it spotty in order to make it more interesting to myself.Â  Instead, I just got really fed up of drawing and colouring circles.Â  But by writing out my structure, arguments, conclusions, information about my sources, and future research ideas (which will remain unfulfilled), I hopefully reminded myself of them.Â  I also labelled those important bits in my personal copy of my thesis so I can find them easily if anyone asks about them:</p>

<p>My next task was to practice answering the â€˜typicalâ€™ questions (you can just about see some of them):</p>

<p><img src="/images/viva-prep-4.jpg" alt="A selection of possible viva questions" /></p>

<p>This was probably my least favourite part of my revision.Â  There were so many questions, and I could think of lots of answers for some of them (which I suppose boosts my chances of remembering at least one of the answers if I get asked the questions), and it took me ages to answer even just the questions that were actually relevant to the humanities:</p>

<p>With some questions, I just ended up using the same information in different ways:</p>

<p><img src="/images/viva-prep-6.jpg" alt="A card featuring a selection of viva questions that would have similar answers" /></p>

<p>I got very fed up, and to be honest, I only ended up skimming the questions and what Iâ€™d written afterwards.Â  Hopefully the value was in finding out I had answers to the questions, and writing them down.Â  I took care to listen to my body and avoid burning out:</p>

<p>I treated the questions ofÂ â€˜what did you find most interesting?â€™,Â â€˜what are you proud of?â€™ andÂ â€˜what surprised you?â€™ differently, though.Â  I found <em>lots</em> of things interesting/pride-inducing/surprising, so I guess Iâ€™m not completely jaded yet:</p>

<p>More interesting was the opportunity to refresh myself on my examinersâ€™ work/read it for the first time (the department appointed me a new internal examiner at the last minute and I was unfamiliar with her work).Â  It was fun to read something new, as well as admire the view from the library one last time.Â  God, Iâ€™m going to miss Essex.Â  It doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve been there for four years.</p>

<p>I also reread my notes on some of the more important secondary books I read.Â  If Iâ€™d had the time, Iâ€™d have liked to have reread some of the actual books, but as my viva date wasnâ€™t confirmed until quite late on, and I had all those job interviews to prepare for the other week, I had to go for breadth rather than depth.Â  So in a way, itâ€™s a good thing I didnâ€™t get a job earlier.</p>

<p>So, those are the hard work aspects of preparing for the viva.Â  I also kept a list of hints and tips within sight to help:</p>

<p>I think Iâ€™ve done all I can, really.Â  Tonight Iâ€™m going to relax and do everything I can do induce sleep, bar taking drugs or getting someone to knock me out.Â  My viva is at 11am BST - wish me luck!</p>
