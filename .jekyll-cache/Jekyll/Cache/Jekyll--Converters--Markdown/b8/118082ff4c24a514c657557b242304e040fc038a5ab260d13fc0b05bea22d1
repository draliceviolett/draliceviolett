I"ˆ<p>This week Iâ€™ve been writing.Â  A lot.Â  Iâ€™ve produced nearly 2,000 words more than I expected to in the amount of time Iâ€™ve had, and a topic (the Mass Observation Family Survey) I thought would take up 4,000 words maximum has just hit exactly 8,000 (pre-editing, of course, and with a couple of bits I know I need to add).Â  Itâ€™s been like Lisa Simpson and the tap shoes, but with academic writing.Â  Iâ€™m doing it because my next board paper is due on 9th June, the actual board being on the 19th.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I said I wasnâ€™t sure if I liked the actual act of academic writing so much as <em>having written</em>, in the same way I donâ€™t like hoovering, but I like <em>having hoovered</em>.Â  But from this week, I need to add a caveat to that.Â  I love academic writing when itâ€™s going smoothly; when I have loads to say and I can figure out how to say it, itâ€™s (dare I say it) fun.Â  A combination of an interesting topic and an abundance of energy (I donâ€™t know why, Iâ€™m just really â€˜onâ€™ this week) has made this a really productive week.Â  Perhaps even <em>too</em> productive - I might get disappointed if I have to delete too much of it, or if I canâ€™t maintain this level of activity when Iâ€™m writing the â€˜child guidance/psychologyâ€™ part of the chapter, or Iâ€™ve simply produced more words than the board will consider looking at in one go (possibly resulting in submitting disjointed-looking parts of it!).</p>

<p>I usually write in one of two ways.Â  Sometimes I just type straight into the computer.Â  I get the job done, but it can be a bit slow - itâ€™s hard to juggle all my notes when my laptop is taking up pretty much my entire workspace, and distractions abound.Â  This week, and at some times in the past, Iâ€™ve written into a notebook, and then typed it all into the computer in one big undistracted frenzy, changing things as I go along so Iâ€™ve essentially done two drafts already.Â  Iâ€™ve been doing that this week, and why I donâ€™t do that all the time, I donâ€™t know.Â  Sure, my hand has been absolutely killing me, as when youâ€™ve got a lot to say, scribbling it all out is a bit harder on the hand than typing it.Â  Iâ€™ve used up most of a (small) notebook and I have no idea how my pen is still working.Â  But, for a first draft, it just seems a lot easier than using a computer.Â  The big pain of writing on a computer is that I like to do my references as I go along, and writing out a full reference can break your flow if youâ€™re putting your thoughts directly onto a computer, whereas with writing, I can just put â€˜blahblah page blahblahâ€™ in brackets and carry on - it doesnâ€™t break the flow so much inputting the references on a computer if youâ€™re only copying something out anyway.</p>

<p>The Mass Observation surveys Iâ€™ve got 8,000 words from are my favourite thing Iâ€™ve looked at so far for my thesis. Â I already blogged about them a few weeks ago, but even when I was just reading through them and taking notes, I was thinking â€˜wow, this is really interestingâ€™. Â Iâ€™m not actually sure that Mass Observation actually made anything from the 1949 Family Survey, so by analysing it so much I feel like Iâ€™ve really discovered something. Â Iâ€™ve found out even more by taking a closer look at them - the biggest thing being the more extreme views on only children to be found among the more middle-class respondents of 1949 compared to the predominantly working-class ones of 1944. Â Iâ€™ve also had to think about how the differences in the two surveys and motivations of the subjects had this effect. Â I actually think I could get a conference talk and a journal article out of this as well - it could even be my talk for the Social History Societyâ€™s 2015 conference!</p>

<p>I am wondering if blogging has helped me with my writing.Â  Doing a blog about Mass Obs a few weeks ago did help me organise my thoughts on what Iâ€™d read, though Iâ€™ve obviously looked at the survey responses a lot more deeply this time around. Â I think itâ€™s kept me in the writing loop while Iâ€™ve been doing my research, and kept me aware that I enjoy at least one type of writing. Â Iâ€™m also wondering if I have a future in social research of the present day!</p>

<p>I hope next weekâ€™s post about continuing to write is just as upbeat.</p>

Â It is now in retirement, but comes out for iPod-syncing because itâ€™s too much work to transfer my iPod to my new one.</p>
