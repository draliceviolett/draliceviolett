I"·<p>Itâ€™s done. Again. For now.</p>

<p>I submitted my completely rewritten thesis this morning, right on the deadline. For 8 months I gave most of my weekends, a chunk of my annual leave, and some evenings to writing. It culminated in me reading the whole thing through for most of yesterday before diving into bed with a splitting headache.</p>

<p>My main feeling is relief. I got it done. Eight months ago, I was on the verge of quitting because I felt there was no way I could possibly do it. Iâ€™m pleased that I did manage it, but thatâ€™s tempered by the feeling that it would have been totally fine to quit - I only didnâ€™t because Iâ€™d have still had to pay Â£250 for a term that had started - as well as the feeling that Iâ€™ve now â€˜put myself out thereâ€™ by resubmitting it to the examiners, who werenâ€™t impressed by it last time.</p>

<p>I can tell itâ€™s better than my first submission. I read the original now and think, â€˜wow, that <em>was</em> a bit crap really,â€™ and have to remind myself that if Iâ€™d known it wasnâ€™t good enough then, I wouldnâ€™t have submitted it. Thereâ€™s stuff I wanted to add but didnâ€™t have time to do, and I have acknowledged that within the thesis. I think Iâ€™ve addressed the examinersâ€™ comments. Iâ€™m still anxious as hell about having a second viva because I know how badly it can go wrong, and I just canâ€™t trust that what Iâ€™ve done is worthy of a PhD.</p>

<p>My experience of resubmitting has been very different to submitting the first time. Last time, I finished my thesis a bit before the deadline and had time to proofread it with fresh eyes. I even got it printed a couple of days before submitting. As I mentioned above, this time I finished my final read-through at 9pm the day before submitting, and got it printed on the day. I roped in a load of kind friends to give my chapters a read a week or so before it was due. Even if I had finished earlier, I wouldnâ€™t have been able to print it ahead of time because I had work.</p>

<p>When I submitted before, I felt elated, though it also felt kind of anticlimactic. Nonetheless, I basically spent three days eating and drinking everything in sight. This time, Iâ€™m looking forward to spending the afternoon with a book, maybe having a nap, going for a meal, seeing a play in a library (not the one I work at, but you can see something by yours truly about the play <a href="https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/health/librarian-theatre/">here</a>, and I might also have a bath. Itâ€™s all very civilised. Well, I do have work tomorrow. And every weekday until Easter, because I have one day of annual leave left in this financial year and I have to keep it aside in case my viva is in March.</p>

<p>Having work is another difference between this time and the last. When I submitted before, I didnâ€™t know what was coming next. I spent most of the three months between submitting and viva looking and applying for jobs, and getting work experience, before securing a position a couple of weeks before my viva. Although I hope to try to progress in my career at some point, I donâ€™t want to start looking form my next job until I know whatâ€™s going on with my PhD. Iâ€™m happy to just â€˜beâ€™ for however long it is until all this is over, doing the job Iâ€™m settled into and not spending my spare time on anything too onerous.</p>

<p>Another difference, as Iâ€™ve already indicated, is how I feel about the viva. Last time, nobody suggested that anything untoward would happen. I felt as though it would be a nice chat about my work, and just a formality really. I didnâ€™t expect there to be so much criticism of my work. Iâ€™m going to be anxious as hell this time around, but if itâ€™s horrible, at least it wonâ€™t be as much of a shock. Hopefully.</p>

<p>Even if I still donâ€™t pass (so I keep telling myself), unlike last time, getting a PhD doesnâ€™t seem like the be-all and end-all. Yeah, Iâ€™ll be very annoyed that I spent more than 4 years on it, and ~Â£900 trying to fix it. It might be hard not to beat myself up about being a failure at least for a bit, and Iâ€™d probably need some professional help dealing with that. But, from working in a different area for more than a year, Iâ€™ll know itâ€™s not the end of the world. I donâ€™t need a PhD for the sort of work I want to do. I think itâ€™s more important to my future, for example, that I now have substantial experience of working in an office. But I would, ideally, like to have something to show for all the money, time, and effort I put into it.</p>

<p>A final difference? My acknowledgements are longer this time. Iâ€™ve got so many people cheering me on. When I got referred, I didnâ€™t do anything on social media for days because I was scared of how people would react to the fact my work wasnâ€™t â€˜good enoughâ€™ to pass. But Iâ€™ve had so much support from everyone, and itâ€™s made me feel so much better. Thank you all so much.</p>
