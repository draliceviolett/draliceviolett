I"<p>This week has been all about the <strong>primary sources</strong>, both <strong>online</strong> and <strong>offline</strong>.  On Monday I went to the <strong>British Library</strong> to read a couple of books I hadn’t been able to get hold of elsewhere, and transcribed most of an oral history interview.  The rest of the time, I’ve been using the <strong>internet</strong> to find out extra information about the nineteenth-century guidance books I’ve read so far.  I’ve also found a couple more such books I want to read along the way, and got a four-week trial for <a href="http://www.amdigital.co.uk/m-collections/collection/mass-observation-online/">Mass Observation Online</a>, which I’m massively excited about using - it looks so interesting!</p>
