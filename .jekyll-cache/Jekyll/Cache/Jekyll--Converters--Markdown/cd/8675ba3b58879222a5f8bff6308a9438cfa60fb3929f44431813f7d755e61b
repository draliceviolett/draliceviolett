I"á<p>I must admit, in the past I have been a little taken in by the â€˜Bletchley mythâ€™ - that during WWII, Bletchley Park was full of geniuses doing really exciting work, something Iâ€™d have liked to have been a part of had I been around then.Â  Tessa Dunlopâ€™s <em>Bletchley Girls</em> effectively dispels those myths, and thatâ€™s one of the things I like about it.Â  The book is based on interviews with 15 women whose work was either at or linked to the Park, and Dunlop makes it clear that these women were either average or above-average (as opposed to geniuses) in intelligence, and that many of the jobs were mind-numbingly tedious, and it was not made particularly obvious to them how significant their work actually was.</p>
