I"ý<p>This thesis is getting finished in the next few months.Â  Thereâ€™s little doubt about that.Â  Itâ€™ll be cool to not have to work on it any more, and to be a doctor.Â  But honestly, Iâ€™m terrified about whatâ€™s going to happen after that.</p>

<p>I stand by what I said in <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhigher-education-network%2F2016%2Fjan%2F18%2Fmy-phd-busts-the-old-stereotypes-about-selfish-smug-only-children%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw&amp;t=M2QzMzA4ZDg1Zjk5ZmUxNzIzN2M3MDI4MWZmYjg1Y2JjOWNmZTk4MSxwVmNheWl1ZQ%3D%3D">my Guardian article</a> the other week - I love being a PhD student.Â  I love the freedom, and the research, and the opportunities.Â  But I canâ€™t see how an academic career will work for me.Â  I keep seeing postdocs, thinking they look fabulously enjoyable, and desperately wishing I could apply for them as Iâ€™m full of new research ideas - but they will prevent me from leaving home for at least another two years.Â  I want to buy a house, and for that I need a salary, not a grant.Â  Iâ€™m pretty sure I want to leave home more than I want to stay in academia, at least for now.Â  Itâ€™s not so much that I feel like all my peers are getting their own homes and itâ€™s seen as a bit sad to still be at home in your late twenties - though that is part of it - but while my parents are lovely and their home is pleasant, Iâ€™m at a stage where I <em>need</em> more space and more control over my surroundings.Â  That and after nearly ten years with my boyfriend, itâ€™s about time we moved in together, and renting isnâ€™t an option when none of the letting agents in Colchester seem to know how a phone works.Â  And then thereâ€™s the worry.Â  If I enter short contract after short contract, Iâ€™m going to go through months of anxiety every time one comes to an end, and it feels bad enough that Iâ€™m having to deal with that now.Â  Moving from place to place all the time wonâ€™t be exactly great for me mentally, either.</p>

<p>But at least, being based in and familiar with Essex, I live/can live near enough to London to commute, and that is where many of the â€˜alternativeâ€™ jobs I would like to do seem to be.Â  One option I love the idea of is working in academic publishing, on the editorial side.Â  I love the writing aspect of my PhD, and I like improving other peopleâ€™s (rather than my own!) work, so thatâ€™s a part of my brain that Iâ€™d gladly engage in a job.Â  I think the way in would be through an internship, which Iâ€™m in more of a position to do than when I left university last time.Â  Itâ€™s just finding such opportunities, though.Â  Everyone talks about â€˜career planningâ€™, but other than vaguely knowing what you want to do, I donâ€™t know how you can really plan a career.Â  If thereâ€™s one thing graduating in a recession taught me, itâ€™s that the opportunities arenâ€™t always there, and that there can be fierce competition that stops you getting what you want.Â  And then there are things like illness which also mean you canâ€™t totally plan your life.</p>

<p>Another option Iâ€™d like is continuing to work with students, on a one-to-one basis.Â  My favourite parts of teaching are marking and helping students improve their work indidivually, so Iâ€™d love to work in student support or somesuch.Â  I also love the university environment in general.Â  Again, itâ€™s a case of whether the opportunities become available in places I can commute to at the right time.Â  Timing is a major thing - I try not to look at job websites at the moment, because if I see something amazing Iâ€™d like to apply for (not necessarily in publishing or student support, just generally cool cerebral jobs in various industries), I feel really depressed because Iâ€™m not free to get a job yet, and there might not be any cool jobs when I am looking.Â  On the other hand, if I canâ€™t find any jobs I like the look of, I get depressed because I think there wonâ€™t be anything out there for me down the line!</p>

<p>My biggest fear isnâ€™t unemployment.Â  I have savings (privilege alert!), and unlike when I graduated the first time, I have ways to fill my time - I could write some articles, work on a book, or start a new research project with what resources I have available.Â  No, itâ€™s ending up back in retail, or some other routine, soul-destroying job.Â  I worked in retail during sixth form and my BA, and after my BA, and I canâ€™t go through that feeling of boredom, hopelessness, and being trapped again.Â  Itâ€™ll probably be even worse now Iâ€™ve experienced happiness in my employment.Â  Itâ€™s close, but Iâ€™d feel less awful if I was unemployed, to be honest.Â  Maybe if I hadnâ€™t lost two years of my life to retail, and done my MA and PhD two years earlier instead, I could stand to stay at home a bit longer to do a postdoc - but then, I wouldnâ€™t have had the time to really think about whether I wanted to go into postgraduate study, and what I was actually going to research.Â  If I hadnâ€™t been an MA in October 2012, I would never have gone to the colloquium that inspired my PhD research.Â  Swings and roundabouts, I guess.</p>

<p>Sorry if this post is a bit depressing!Â  Iâ€™m just worried, and scaredâ€¦</p>
