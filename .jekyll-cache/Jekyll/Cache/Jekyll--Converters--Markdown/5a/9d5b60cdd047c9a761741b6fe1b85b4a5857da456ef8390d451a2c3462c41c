I"<p>So. this week I started reading some <strong>child guidance manuals</strong>, in order to find out <strong>opinions on only children</strong> as well as <strong>why some of the characteristics attributed to them were so bad</strong>.  So far I’ve made a little headway, but today I’m going to blog about something else that caught my attention but isn’t so much to do with my thesis but might be something I want to follow up in the future.  It concerns <strong>acceptable and unacceptable ways to scare children</strong>.</p>
