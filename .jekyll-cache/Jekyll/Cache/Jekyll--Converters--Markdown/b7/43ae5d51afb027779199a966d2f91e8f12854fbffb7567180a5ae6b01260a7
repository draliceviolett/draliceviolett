I"«<p>As itâ€™s Museum Week, and I happened to go to three museums/exhibitions, and Iâ€™m a history student, it seems like an appropriate time to blog about museums.Â  Terrible, I know, but for a long time I wasnâ€™t the biggest fan of museums.Â  I mean, I thought they were alright, and I even did some volunteering for a couple of museum services, but I had trouble shaking off the old â€˜schoolâ€™ mentality of having to memorise everything I saw in case I was tested on it later.Â  Itâ€™s only as Iâ€™ve got older that Iâ€™ve moved into the position of <em>thinking</em> about objects in museums, and knowledge for its own sake (incidentally, I also read more non-fiction now).</p>
