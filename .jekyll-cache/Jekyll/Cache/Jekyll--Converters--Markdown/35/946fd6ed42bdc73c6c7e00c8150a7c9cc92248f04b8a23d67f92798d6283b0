I"t<p>So, we survived the conference.  Apparently we made it look quite easy, but inside we were like STRESS STRESS STRESS STRESS STRESS.  Anyway, now it’s blog day again, and it’s time for me to write my report.  I’ve decided that rather than adopt a panel-by-panel approach, I’m going to draw out the key themes that really grabbed me during the conference.</p>
