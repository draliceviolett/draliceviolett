I"m<p>I spent the bulk of this week in Portsmouth for the annual Social History Society conference.  For the uninitiated, this is a very big event in the social/cultural historian’s year - three(ish) days packed with talks, as well as chances to network, talk to publishers and buy discounted books.  For each session (typically an hour and a half or two hours long) there are panels in seven ‘strands’ to choose from - I mostly attended the Life-cycles &amp; Life-styles strand, though I also dipped into panels on Economies, Culture &amp; Consumption, Narratives, Emotions and the Self, and Spaces &amp; Places (the other three are Deviance, Inclusion &amp; Exclusion, Global &amp; Transnational Approaches and Political Cultures, Policy &amp; Citizenship - all of which had appealling-looking papers, but alas I cannot split myself in two!).  I often found it difficult to decide which panel to attend as so many looked so good!  As I listened to 25 20-minute papers (26 if you include my own), it would be highly impractical to write about them all, so this blog is about a selection that really stood out for me for reasons relevant, semi-relevant, or totally irrelevant to my own current interests.  If I went to your talk but haven’t written about you here, please be assured that I did find your paper interesting and well-delivered - there was a very high standard!</p>
