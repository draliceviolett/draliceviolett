I"s<p>I am not good at the summer ‘break’.  I have plenty of work to keep me occupied, but everything is so <em>dull</em>, campus is absolutely dead and there are no events to go to.  It’s only since I’ve been at university that I’ve hated this time of year.  Unlike university, the re-starting of school was nothing to look forward to whatsoever, and as a child I had a higher tolerance of daytime TV (only four-and-a-bit channels as well!), no termtime social life to compare with the dead time of summer (this has everything to do with being a misfit introvert and nothing to do with being an only child, by the way), and the internet could keep me entertained for a lot longer when I couldn’t use it until my mum finished working on the computer.  So, to ward off boredom-induced insanity, I’ve been trying to do interesting/new things as an act of self-care.</p>
