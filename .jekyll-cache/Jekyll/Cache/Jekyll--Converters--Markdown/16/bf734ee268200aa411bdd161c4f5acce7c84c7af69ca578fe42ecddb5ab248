I"ï<p>Very short blog this week.Â  Iâ€™ll actually be at a conference when this appears online (the wonders of Tumblr), so thatâ€™ll give me something to write about next week at least!Â  Just popping in really, to keep the â€˜x weeks to goâ€™ thing going, and say that on Monday, I finished the fine-tooth comb edit of my thesis.Â  I somehow managed to delete enough words that it ended up at 80,000 exactly, which Iâ€™m pretty amazed by.Â  Of course, Iâ€™ll read it through again at some point in the next three weeks, and I need to change the margins (which will probably mess up all my footnotes and page breaks) and add all the paraphernalia at the beginning and end, but thatâ€™s all formalities really.Â  For all intents and purposes, my thesis is done.</p>

<p>I started looking for jobs.Â  I looked all afternoon on Monday and found a grand total of two that had suitable pay and hours and that I would be in any way considered for.Â  Wondering if people are holding off advertising jobs until after the referendum.Â  Of course, if we leave the EU, chances are there wonâ€™t be any jobs and Iâ€™ll be in the exact same position I was in when I first graduated, six years ago, at the height of the recession.</p>

<p>VOTE REMAIN.Â  I NEED A GODDAMN JOB.</p>
