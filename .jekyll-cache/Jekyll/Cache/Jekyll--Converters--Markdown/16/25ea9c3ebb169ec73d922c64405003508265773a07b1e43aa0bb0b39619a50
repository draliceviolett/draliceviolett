<p>Unusual skills they donâ€™t tell you youâ€™ll learn at postgrad level, #5: overstimulation by books.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m deadly serious.Â  This afternoon/evening after a library-related mishap meant my plans for finishing my literature review fell through, I read 120 or so pages of Christina Hardymentâ€™s <em>Dream Babies</em> and my brain is buzzing with ideas.Â  Her bibliography contains a load of old childcare manuals I want to check out, she included in her work the views of one of them on the subject of only children, and Iâ€™m getting a load of ideas of the qualities parents were and werenâ€™t advised to cultivate in their children, and how these changed over time.Â  Iâ€™m getting ideas for research that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into my PhD but could make for some good blog posts if I find time to pursue it.Â  Yay!</p>
