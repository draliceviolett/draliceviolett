I"º<p>Last week I happened across <a href="https://twitter.com/HARTResearch/status/487488929839714304">this tweet</a>, asking whether we see ourselves as doctoral students or doctoral researchers.Â  I found it a very interesting question to ponder!Thus far, Iâ€™ve automatically referred to myself as a student whenever the occasion to provide my occupation has arisen.Â  In much the same way, I automatically tick â€˜Missâ€™, even though my sensibilities say my marital status is nothing to do with anything - a hangover from youth, possibly (and I get to avoid the whole â€˜Miss/Msâ€™ thing when I become a doctor, yay!).Â  And in some ways, I am a student.Â  The big one is that Iâ€™m producing a piece of work, someoneâ€™s judgment on which will or wonâ€™t result in a qualification.Â  I have a student ID, get student discount and take am automatically a member of the Student Union, whose events I partake in.Â  I socalise with the student body rather than the staff, and were I to become a department committee member, I would be representing students.Â  Any grants I apply for are designated for â€˜studentsâ€™, and I can take advantage of conferences and events aimed specifically at â€˜studentsâ€™.</p>
