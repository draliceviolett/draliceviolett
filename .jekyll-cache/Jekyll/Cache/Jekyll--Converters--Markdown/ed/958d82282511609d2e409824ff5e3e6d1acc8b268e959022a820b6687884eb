I"â<p>I say itâ€™s not a survival guide because there really wasnâ€™t much <em>to</em> survive.Â  At least now I donâ€™t have to worry about future boards because I know that unless I just completely stop working or produce a horrendous paper, itâ€™s going to be OK.Â  Let this be a reassurance to future PhDs, or those who havenâ€™t had their boards yet.Â  This post is a mixture of reflection and advice.</p>

<p>Bear in mind Iâ€™m a history student, so this advice might not apply to students of other disciplines.Â  I had to do an 8,000-10,000 (it ended up a few hundred words longer than that, oops!) piece of writing, which was basically the first draft of the introduction to my thesis; literature review and sources.Â  The only preparation I really had to do apart from that was re-read what Iâ€™d written the night before.Â  Thatâ€™s all you can really do - <strong>the board is about your research, which you already intimately know</strong>.</p>

<p>When I went in, Iâ€™d prepared myself to <strong>accentuate the positive</strong>.Â  To this end, I wrote down good things the board said about my work and put a ring around them so that they would stand out on the page later.Â  I was particularly pleased to hear that I write well - I always like to be complimented on my writing as being a good writer is something Iâ€™ve always aspired to.Â  I was also happy to hear that <strong>Iâ€™ve crossed disciplinary boundaries well</strong>.Â  This related particularly to my reading of contemporary psychology works that have something to say about the only child.Â  I was worried I wasnâ€™t equipped enough to deal with what is basically an alien set of terms and ideas, but so far, I donâ€™t seem to be doing too shabbily.Â  And I love the idea of <strong>interdisciplinary work</strong> in general.Â  Not only is it really interesting, but it breathes new life into old topics, so Iâ€™m pleased to be contributing to that culture.</p>

<p>The board members <strong>suggested lots of things for me to read</strong>.Â  When I was having MA supervisory meetings, I used to be overwhelmed by the number of books and articles my supervisor suggested on the basis of what Iâ€™d written.Â  Now Iâ€™m used to it, though, it doesnâ€™t seem so bad.Â  Often itâ€™s only a chapter or two, or even just a small section of a work thatâ€™s relevant, and not only is it helpful, but itâ€™s quite nice to be able to read books and have a good idea of exactly what it is youâ€™re looking for in them.Â  After a celebratory cup of hot chocolate, I went straight to the library and looked up all the works that had been suggested to me.Â  While <strong>my reading pile is now huge, Iâ€™m still not worried</strong>.Â  Because itâ€™s PhD, that bit of work can lie fallow for a bit as nobodyâ€™s going to want to see it for a while, and <strong>thereâ€™s no rush to read all those books</strong> and add to it,Â  <strong>So I guess my advice here would be: donâ€™t be overwhelmed by the suggested reading!Â Â </strong>Also, write down the names of historians yourself - the board memberd may have written them down on your work for you, but <strong>itâ€™s not only medi</strong><strong>cal doctors who have horrendous handwriting</strong>.</p>

<p>I know this sounds like a clichÃ© (I heard it so many times in the run-up to the board, but I never quite let myself believe it) but <strong>the board really is there to support you</strong>.Â  I got loads of suggestions about how to continue my work, it was brilliant!Â  One of my favourites were <strong>having a section about the only child and social mobility</strong>, particularly as the parents of only children were more likely to be able to afford to send them to <strong>grammar school</strong> or <strong>let them sta</strong><strong>y on at school</strong>, and in the old days at least (I wonâ€™t go into my experiences of grammar schoolâ€¦), that was a springboard to a better job, and a higher social position.Â  My other favourite was the idea of doing <strong>case studies</strong>.Â  Iâ€™m a little worried that I wonâ€™t be able to get hold of a huge number of <strong>autobiographies of only children</strong>, so to be able to just use a few really interesting ones appeals to me.Â  I also might get so much from the** oral histories** that I wonâ€™t need to use as many as I thought.Â  We shall see!</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>be prepared for the conversation to wander all over the place, especially if your subject is particularly â€˜human interestâ€™</strong>.Â  After all, your board are colleagues, so they like a good chat.Â  I ended up hearing a few anecdotes about the <strong>board membersâ€™ own experiences of only children</strong>, and <strong>â€˜virtual onliesâ€™</strong> (a phrase Iâ€™ve literally just coined there) who grew up alone due to family circumstances such as <strong>large age gaps</strong> or <strong>going to live with other relatives</strong>.Â  According to my supervisors two previous PhD students, this is not an unusual occurrence - the board members had anecdotes about <strong>household accidents **and **prostitution</strong>.Â  Itâ€™s quite nice - it shows your topic is <strong>alive and of interest</strong> to people.</p>

<p>So, what next?Â  Iâ€™m getting back to work on the sources that will make up my next board paper.Â  I hope it receives as good a reception as this paper did, and that my experiences and advice, such as they are, are of use to somebody out there!</p>
