I"Í<p>Itâ€™s two weeks today since I submitted my thesis.Â  As planned, Iâ€™ve kept myself as busy as possible, as I fear that if I stay still for too long, Iâ€™ll think too much and the enormity of finishing my PhD, being unemployed, and having to change my routine will hit me and Iâ€™ll end up a gibbering wreck.Â  I have plenty to do for the foreseeable, not least because I havenâ€™t looked at my thesis again yet, and I still need to do some journal articles at some point.</p>

<p>My main activity has been applying for jobs.Â  So far Iâ€™ve applied for nine, been rejected outright for four, been rejected after interview for two, havenâ€™t heard back from two after a month, and have one Iâ€™m waiting on.Â  I â€˜failedâ€™ both interviews for the same reason: although I apparently did really well, there happened to be someone else with more relevant experience.Â  On the one hand, itâ€™s reassuring that I am okay at interviews, which used to be a huge weakness for me, but on the other, itâ€™s frustrating that itâ€™s come down to luck, so thereâ€™s nothing I can really work on to make sure do better at future interviews, and what if Iâ€™m so unlucky that thereâ€™s <em>always</em> someone more relevant?Â  I am actually being surprisingly philosophical, picking myself up quickly after rejections, telling myself its early days yet, and concentrating on the positive feedback.Â  Whether Iâ€™ll still feel the same was after my 10th interview rejection is something else.</p>

<p>Last week, I filled Friday by heading to London a â€˜Life After The PhDâ€™ event at the Institute of Historical Research, held by History Lab.Â  It was nice to hang out with scholars (who have the <em>best</em> reactions to me finishing my PhD because they really â€˜getâ€™ what a big deal it is) and hear that people with PhDs in history do actually get jobs.Â  However, it confirmed for me that I definitely donâ€™t want to stay in academia, which might not have been what they were hoping for.Â  Hearing stories about taking three or more years to find a full-time academic job, and taking short-term and teaching posts in the meantime, uprooting oneself and oneâ€™s partner/family every year just made me realise even more that thatâ€™s not what I want to do.Â  I have neither the privilege (more on that in a minute) or patience to do that.Â  I already spent two years of my life in a job I didnâ€™t want, feeling incredibly depressed and like I was wasting time and not using my talents, and I canâ€™t help but look back on those two years as a waste I donâ€™t want to repeat.Â  Doing a PhD was a way to solve that problem of directionlessness and worthlessness, and now I want to get on with my life, and not end up being 30 before my first â€˜realâ€™ job.Â </p>

<p>A fellow conference attendee did raise the issue of privilege - being in the position to take short-term and/or part-time jobs, or do some volunteering in a museum - and it chimed with me.Â  I recognise that I have some privilege: Iâ€™ve saved enough money to avoid the Jobcentre, who would NOT be sympathetic to me being picky about jobs (and thatâ€™s in a situation where between them, the fields Iâ€™m looking in have way more openings than academia), think you should be spending all of your time looking for and applying for jobs (soul-destroying) and not volunteering or using your time productively in any other way, and apparently donâ€™t understand that if you have a PhD, you can probably skip the functional literacy and numeracy tests.Â  I have a roof over my head, even if it is my parentsâ€™ and I donâ€™t have a lot of space or control over my surroundings.Â  Nonetheless, I canâ€™t afford to wait for a job for two years - my savings are really for a house deposit, and Iâ€™m trying to spend as little as I can for that reason.Â  I donâ€™t have the privilege of being able to remain mentally strong during a long period of joblessness; work is integral to my sense of purpose as a person.</p>

<p>I have been using the privilege of savings and not having to get any old job that pays the bills to do a spot of work experience for <a href="http://www.glassofbubbly.com">Glass of Bubbly</a>, a magazine about Champagne, Prosecco and sparkling wine which is based in my town.Â  Iâ€™ve been mainly working on the social media side, producing my own content as well as rewriting press releases for the news section.Â  Iâ€™ve also done a bit of proofreading and blurb research and writing for the magazine itself, and had a little go at photography.Â  I was a bit wary when I first went for it - I know nothing about sparkling wines except that some of them taste nice, would it just be watching Twitter notifications all day, would I like writing content about products for clicks when Iâ€™m used to writing ground-breaking ideas? - but Iâ€™m actually really enjoying it.Â  I like working with words, and things like picking out the important bits of an indulgent press release and doing a bit of research to beef up a post uses some of the same skills I loved using as a PhD student.Â  Itâ€™s a really informal placement, as the couple who produce the magazine do it from their home, and I just do a day here and there so I can still fit in the gym and job applications and interviews.Â  Last week, I couldnâ€™t do Thursday because I was filming for an online course for incoming history first-years at the university.Â  At first I was a bit wary because I donâ€™t like being recorded, but I went for it because I was paid, and only a few people would see it.Â  I surprised myself by managing to answer pre-prepared questions about history study clearly and quite concisely without access to my cue cards!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been taking care to look after myself.Â  Last week I received some <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/365daysofselfcare?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=hash">#365daysofselfcare</a> sticky notes, providing a perfectly-timed excuse to think about what I can do to make myself feel good.Â  So far Iâ€™ve done face masks, baths, colouring, eating ice cream, and watching DVDs - all fairly low-cost things really.Â  I want to take a holiday and get some new glasses, but, as I mentioned, Iâ€™m wary about spending money when I donâ€™t know how long what I have has to last me.Â  But considering how I thought Iâ€™d feel about completing (based largely on finishing my BA at the height of a recession, having to sign on, having to go for jobs I didnâ€™t want or wasnâ€™t really qualified for, not knowing how to do interviews, and having less confidence and skills than I have now), Iâ€™m doing okay.</p>
