I"«<p>One very important thing you need to do a PhD is space to work in - somewhere you can plonk your laptop and/or books and <em>concentrate</em>.Â  This blog features some of the places Iâ€™ve worked in the past month or so.Â Â </p>

<p>I tend to work from home as itâ€™s particularly conducive to work - I donâ€™t have to faff around with waiting for and travelling on buses, and although my parents are always around, theyâ€™re not too noisy.Â  This is my workspace at home:</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a little bit of a squeeze as itâ€™s a small desk (I couldnâ€™t fit a larger one in) in the corner of my bedroom.Â  I dream of having my own home with a dedicated office!Â  Nevertheless, this is still my favourite place to work - all my notes and books and stationery are close to hand, and it suits my slightly hermit-like nature.Â  If Iâ€™m using my laptop and written notes or a book at the same time, the latter has to go in my lap, which isnâ€™t ideal, which is why itâ€™s sometimes nice to make use of a bigger tableâ€¦</p>

<p>This is the dining room table, which I made use of for writing when my parents were away.Â  Thereâ€™s something quite official-feeling about sitting at a proper table to do some writingâ€¦</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s even space for my research assistant to sit down, though naturally he had to sit on my notes when there was virtually a whole tableâ€™s space to choose from.</p>

<p>Like one of those hipster types, I sometimes like to work in cafÃ©s - like the dining room table, thereâ€™s just something special about it.Â  But itâ€™s not something I make a habit of - I fear the health effects of too much hot chocolate, and thereâ€™s always the â€˜is getting there going to be too much time and effort?â€™ dilemma.</p>

<p>Fear not, I do go to campus sometimes.Â  There is a graduate room in my department but Iâ€™m not a huge fan of it myself - itâ€™s too computer-heavy, with no space for reading/handwriting/laptops.Â  It really works for some people though.Â  Soon there will be a new library wing opening with space for graduate students, so hopefully that will be better for me.Â  The above picture is of the existing part of the library, where I tend to work if I have to get some books out, to save going to campus just to pick the books up.Â  I havenâ€™t worked there much recently because of the undergraduate exams - too much disturbance, too little space!Â  I like working in the library when itâ€™s quiet, but I wouldnâ€™t go out of my way to work there if I have what I need at home, which is very convenient and less stringent about eating and drinking!</p>
