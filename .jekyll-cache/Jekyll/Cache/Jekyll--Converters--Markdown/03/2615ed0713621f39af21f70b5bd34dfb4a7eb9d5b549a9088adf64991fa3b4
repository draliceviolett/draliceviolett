I"ú<p>I took a week off from blogging (and pretty much everything else) last week because my partner and I took a holiday in York.Â  I definitely needed some work-free time between the busy-ness of the conference and the onslaught of a new term (not that Iâ€™m complaining about the latter, mindâ€¦).Â  We did all the tourist-y things, including visiting a few museums - well, you canâ€™t _not _visit museums on a visit to York!Â  As ever, it was the human stories that interested me most in the museums.</p>
