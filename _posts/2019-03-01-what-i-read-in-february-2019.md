I read 11 non-fiction, crime and thriller, fantasy and historical fiction books in February, yet my TBR list never gets any smaller. I had lots of reservations come through, with more arriving soon, and I'm always spotting books I like the look of. My next read is <cite>This is Going to Hurt</cite>, by Adam Kay, several months after virtually everyone else read it!

## Looking ahead...

![The Glass Woman, All Out, Potkin and Stubbs, The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy, The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt](/images/february-collage-4.jpg)

I do love a bit of Gothic/scary historical fiction (I absolutely devoured <cite>The Familiars, by Stacey Halls</cite> this week, and <cite>The Corset</cite>, by Laura Purcell, was one of [my favourite books of 2018](/book-blog/2019/01/02/best-of-2018/)) so I'm really looking forward to getting my hands on <cite>The Glass Woman</cite>, by Caroline Lea. And how beautiful is that cover?!

I picked up <cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite>, by Sarah Armstrong, at her author event at [Red Lion Books](http://www.redlionbooks.co.uk/) last month and haven't had time to read it yet, so it's near the top of my TBR list.

As mentioned above, I gave Mackenzi Lee's <cite>The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue</cite> five stars last month, so I have high expectations of the sequel, <cite>The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</cite>. Lee is also one of the authors who have contributed a short story to <cite>All Out: the no longer secret stories of queer teens throughout the ages</cite>, edited by Saundra Mitchell, which drew me in with its gorgeous cover and snagged me with its promise of LGBT short stories set across a wide range of historical settings.

I'm really excited to read Sophie Green's first children's book, <cite>Potkin & Stubbs</cite>, and not just because we work together! A journalist helping a ghost investigate their own death, with noir and comedy elements? Sign me up! And don't tell me I'm 'too old' for middle grade books...

I mentioned in [last month's round-up](/book-blog/2019/02/01/what-i-read-in-january-2019/) that I was looking forward to reading <cite>The Stone Circle</cite>, by Elly Griffiths, this month, but my reservation didn't come through in time! It's in transit now, though, so hopefully I'll be reading it very soon.
