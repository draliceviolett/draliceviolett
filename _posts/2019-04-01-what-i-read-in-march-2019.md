excerpt: "Everything apart from the books I planned, apparently."

I read 16 books in March, but only read three of the [books I planned to read](/book-blog/2019/03/01/what-i-read-in-february-2019/). Hoping to get to <cite>The Lady's Guide to Petticoats and Piracy</cite> and <cite>The Wolves of Leninsky Prospekt</cite> this month instead! I read so much last month because some of the books I picked up were easy and/or exciting reads, so I got through them in a day or two.

## Looking ahead...

![The Binding, The Thirteenth Tale, Cruel Acts, All Among the Barley, The Confessions of Frannie Langton](/images/march-collage-5.jpg)

I would very much like to read this books this month! I picked up <cite>The Binding</cite> at a fascinating Essex Book Festival event with the author, Bridget Collins, at Colchester Library. I was attracted to <cite>The Thirteenth Tale</cite> by an amazing [Meet the Author interview with Diane Setterfield](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/new-suggestions/meet-the-author/meet-the-author-diane-setterfield). I've been meaning to read Melissa Harrison's <cite>All Among the Barley</cite> for a while, and its being shortlisted for the New Angle Prize finally got me reserving it.

I always pre-order Jane Casey's books as soon as they're announced so no doubt I'll drop everything to read <cite>Cruel Acts</cite> when it lands on my Kindle. And <cite>The Confessions of Frannie Langton</cite> simply looks right up my street, though I'm not sure if it will come through the reservation system in time for me to read it this month!
