January felt like such a long month, so I'm not surprised I managed to fit in 11 books! It was nearly 12, but I forced myself to go to bed last night with 50 pages left of <cite>The Rumour</cite>, by Lesley Kara. I picked it up at her book event at Colchester Waterstones on Monday, and it's a speedy and twisty read with some brilliant characterisation of the older female characters - which one is the infamous child killer?

My reading chickens are really coming home to roost this month! I've been waiting for my reservations of <cite>The Silence of the Girls</cite>, by Pat Barker, and <cite>The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue</cite>, by Mackenzi Lee for *ages*, and I preordered February releases <cite>The Wych Elm</cite>, by Tana French, and <cite>The Stone Circle</cite>, by Elly Griffiths, as soon as I could because they're two authors I love. <cite>Six of Crows</cite> is my first Leigh Bardugo read and it looks really exciting. I think I may have some issues deciding what to read first!
