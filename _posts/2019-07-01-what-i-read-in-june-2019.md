In June I read everything I hoped to, but slacked on the review front. I read some really good books, but either didn't feel I could get a full post out of my thoughts, or didn't know if it was really my place to do so. But I'll include brief thoughts on some of them in this round-up.

![The Furies, All That's Dead, The Five, Never Be Broken, Haverscroft](/images/june-collage-1.jpg)

<cite>The Furies</cite>, by Katie Lowe. <cite>The Craft</cite> meets <cite>The Secret History</cite> with a dash of <cite>The Stranger Diaries</cite> and <cite>Girl in Snow</cite>, with believable teenage characters in a fading seaside town - 4*

<cite>All That's Dead</cite>, by Stuart MacBride. I can never get enough of MacRae and Steel - 4.5*

<cite>The Five: the untold lives of the women killed by Jack the Ripper</cite>, by Hallie Rubenhold. Heartbreaking account of the lack of support or sympathy for the poor in Victorian Britain and necessary corrective to popular images of the Ripper and his victims. They were so much more, and he was so much less - 5*

<cite>Never Be Broken</cite>, by Sarah Hilary - 4*

<cite>Haverscroft</cite>, by S. A. Harris - 4*

![The Anarchists' Club, See What I Have Done, The Porpoise, Big Sky, Things in Jars](/images/june-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>The Anarchists' Club</cite>, by Alex Reeve - 4*

<cite>See What I Have Done</cite>, by Sarah Schmidt - 3.5*

<cite>The Porpoise</cite>, by Mark Haddon - 3.5*

<cite>Big Sky</cite>, by Kate Atkinson. Such a treat to be reunited with Jackson Brodie! Something I especially love about Atkinson's books is that pretty much all the characters are fully fleshed-out, with insights into their thoughts and humorous asides in brackets. Even the dogs have distinct personalities! - 5*

<cite>Things In Jars</cite>, by Jess Kidd - 4*

![Common People, My Sister, The Serial Killer, Thin Air, Diary of a Somebody](/images/june-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>Common People: an anthology of working-class writers</cite>, by Kit De Waal (ed.). An outstanding collection packed with humour and warmth that shows that being working-class isn't something to be 'left behind' if you go to university and/or get a certain type of job. - 5*
