excerpt: "Imagine how much I'd read if I didn't need to sleep quite so much."

It's been a funny old month. I only managed to read three of the five books I hoped to, because I forgot quite how many books were due out. As many of them were library books, I had to prioritise reading them because other people had reservations on them!

There were also a couple of books I read reeeeeally slooooowly because I kept falling asleep while I was reading them - not sure what the exact proportions were of me being very tired and comfortable and them being a bit boring! I love sleeping, but I wish I could keep it to the designated time so I could read more.

<cite>Once Upon a River</cite>, by Diane Setterfield - 5*

<cite>Girl, Woman, Other</cite>, by Bernadine Evaristo. I wish it had been the sole winner of the Booker Prize, I'm quite angry that the first black woman winner had to share it - 5*

<cite>River of Destiny</cite>, by Barbara Erskine. A good read, but not on a level with the other three novels of hers I've read as the characters were all a bit too middle-class, middle-aged and smug, so I didn't warm to them - 4*

<cite>Nocturnes</cite>, by John Connolly - 4.5*

![Bone China, French Exit, Night Music, The Secret Commonwealth](/images/october-collage-2.jpg)

<cite>Bone China</cite>, by Laura Purcell - 4*

<cite>French Exit</cite>, by Patrick deWitt - 3*

<cite>Night Music</cite>, by John Connolly - 4.5*

<cite>The Secret Commonwealth</cite>, by Philip Pullman. An engaging story and I like Lyra as an adult, but can Malcolm please not be romantically interested in her? There's a huge gap between a 31-year-old professor and a 20-year-old student - 4*

![Now You See Them, The Secret of Cold Hill, Ring the Hill, Mistletoe](/images/october-collage-3.jpg)

<cite>Now You See Them</cite>, by Elly Griffiths - 4*

<cite>The Secret of Cold Hill</cite>, by Peter James - 4*

<cite>Ring the Hill</cite>, by Tom Cox - 4*

<cite>Mistletoe</cite>, by Alison Littlewood - 3*

## Looking ahead...

Maybe if I say I'm hoping to read four particular books instead of five, I might actually manage it?

![Ninth House, Nine Elms, Every Dead Thing, Confessions of a Bookseller](/images/october-collage-4.jpg)

Halloween may be over, but scary books are forever! After reading two books of short stories from him, I'm finally launching into John Connolly's huge Charlie Parker series. <cite>Ninth House</cite> by Leigh Bardugo, meanwhile looks very intriguing, and I've enjoyed some of her YA titles.

I ran out of crime novels by Robert Bryndza to read a few months ago so I'm glad <cite>Nine Elms</cite> is finally here, and I enjoyed <cite>Diary of a Bookseller</cite> so I'm really looking forward to the second instalment of Shaun Bythell's memoirs.
