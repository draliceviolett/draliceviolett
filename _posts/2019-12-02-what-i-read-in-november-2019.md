excerpt: "I still have my reservations."
---

November has been a busy month, both book- and life-wise. I had lots of reservations come in at once, many of which were brand new books with queues on, so they jumped straight to the top of my TBR (that's my excuse for not reading all the books I said I would this month, anyway...). I read 11 books around an intense Information Architecture (IA) project at work, a book pre-launch dinner for local booksellers and bloggers (an awesome night that I covered in [my latest book review]()), and a Halestorm gig (NGL I'm still buzzing from it four days later).

<cite>The Sun Sister</cite>, by Lucinda Riley. I love this series because the stories are so interesting and wide-ranging, with lots of action and social/women's history.

I'm glad, though, that Electra has a less rose-tinted view of Pa Salt than her sisters. It's taken a while for one of them to raise that it's maybe a *little* weird and selfish for a rich single man to adopt babies from all over the world to fulfil his fantasy of having seven daughters named after the Pleiades, then be largely absent due to his mystery job while they're brought up by the housekeeper and sent to boarding school with no knowledge of their origins. I'm looking forward to seeing some questions answered in the final book next year! - 4.5*
