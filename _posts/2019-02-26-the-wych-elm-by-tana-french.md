I've enjoyed all of Tana French's books, and had <cite>The Wych Elm</cite> on pre-order as soon as it became available, and felt very jealous of US readers, who got it months before us in the UK! As with her other books, although there is a mystery at the heart of the plot, there's loads going on around it in terms of relationships, ideas, and social commentary.

<cite>The Wych Elm</cite> is told from the point of view of Toby Hennessy, a privileged and lucky man in his late 20s whose world comes crashing down. First, he catches burglars in his flat, and receives a potentially life-changing head injury. Then he finds out his uncle Hugo is dying of a brain tumour, and he is persuaded to stay with him in the old family home, The Ivy House, seeing as he's recuperating and Hugo needs more and more help.

One afternoon there, Toby's small niece and nephew find a human skull inside the eponymous tree in the garden. Someone must have lured the victim into the garden, killed him, and put his body in the wych elm - but who? Paranoia and suspicion grows among the cousins as the detectives play them off against one another, and Toby's life will never be the same again.

The one thing that really drew me in to <cite>The Wych Elm</cite> was the small universe of the Hennessy family. The Ivy House is the constant centre of this universe; it's been in the family for decades, originally belonging to Toby's grandparents before being passed down to Hugo, and the three living generations of the family regularly gather there. Toby, Susanna and Leon are particularly attached to it, having spent childhood summers there under Hugo's lax eye while their parents went on holiday. As someone who's lost such a place for my family relatively recently, I could really relate to the feelings and meanings Toby in particular attached to The Ivy House.

Toby's world shrinks to The Ivy House and his family after his assault, with the exception of his girlfriend, Melissa; it is rare that anyone from outside of the family comes to visit, making the intrusion of the detectives and other police personnel feel all the more shocking. Sometimes, however, I thought the story was a little *too* contained in that you don't hear from the victim's family - I'd have thought they'd be knocking down the door of The Ivy House demanding answers.

The two big themes that get you thinking long after you've finished the book are those of privilege/luck and the reliability of memory. While not a dislikable character *per se*, Toby has had a very easy life; he went to a posh school where he fitted in fine, and got a job and a flat easily enough as an adult. As a consequence, he hasn't always noticed or been greatly affected by the suffering of others close by, and up until his assault, negative events in his life have left little mark on him, as he has always been able to win people around.

In <cite>The Wych Elm</cite>, Tana French has created a small, self-contained universe full of paranoia and suspicion and raised questions about the reliability of memory and what makes someone 'good'.
